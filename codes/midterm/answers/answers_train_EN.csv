0,"The granularity should be low because we want to know whether users overall will click more on the ad, not how individual users will click on it. The attribution period should be long (around 30 days) because there might be cases where users are not familiar with the new location and click on it by mistake at first, which might make the data inaccurate.
"
1,"Agree because it is collecting data from multiple users and is checked by clicking ads, so there are only two possible cases: click or not click."
2,"Granularity should be #checkout events/ #cookies because we want to see how many times a person clicks, cookies will get the same person, and it works for a non login attribution period of about 2 days because not all products are of interest to us, so we need to allow time for the user to find products they like."
3,"Agree. Let X~Binomial(N,p), where p is the ratio of the user clicking ad, be able to test whether p_treatment &gt; p_control or not."
4,"Agreed, because A/B Testing is an effective way to measure the effect of interesting changes between two options (A and B) without affecting other variables, which is similar to Hamtaro&#39;s case of testing an ad placement move. Using A/B Testing, we can clearly and immediately measure whether changing ad placements has an effect on sales."
5,Hamtaro should use A/B testing for testing because A/B testing allows us to see the difference in sales between moving and not moving the ad at the same time.
6,The click-through period and total views are set to 1 day because it shows how many viewers clicked on the ad compared to the total viewers.
7,"Granularity in A/B testing on Hamtube ad placement migration refers to the choice of measuring values such as clicks at the top. Attribution period is the time period set to track user activity after seeing an ad. The length of the attribution period should be set appropriately to the nature of your business and product, such as 7 days or 30 days, to obtain complete data and effectively compare results."
8,"Because A/B testing is about comparing the results of changing just one thing, in this case, the ad position, A/B testing is the right way to experiment."
9,"The 50/50 model can collect samples quickly, but the problems that may occur from the new experimental model will affect half of the users. The 80/20 model will affect a small number of users, not much impact on the platform, making it safer. But it also slows down the sample collection. For hamtube, I think the change in the placement of the ad will not affect the users who watch the video that much. But if hamtube has a revenue sharing with the users who upload the video, this experiment may affect them. If there is no sharing, I think doing a 50/50 sharing to collect samples quickly so that the business can make more profit. It will be a good choice for investors who want to see the business grow quickly. If there is, I think doing the 50/50 again because if the sample collection is fast, the decision can be made quickly as well."
10,"50/50 Advantages: Get information quickly. Disadvantages: High risk because if users do not like the new system (ads that move positions), it may affect the business. 80/20 Advantages: Lower risk because there are few users who will be affected if it is not good. Disadvantages: It will take a long time to collect information. Choose 80/20 because Hamtube is the number 1 famous platform in the universe, so a bad user experience can have a huge impact on Hamtube&#39;s business."
11,"A/B testing is useful for Hamtaro to test ad placements for the following main reasons: Data-driven decision making: It allows Hamtaro to make decisions based on real data from the results of the experiment, not just guesswork. Reduce risk: If a new ad placement doesn&#39;t work, it can revert to the old one. Understand users: It helps to understand user behavior and preferences better. Improve user experience: It can help users have a better experience with the platform."
12,"The 50/50 ratio is very risky because 50% of users will see the new format ads. If the new format is not good, users may not like it and stop using Hamtube. And with a ratio of 50%, it is very risky. But with a high ratio, we can quickly know which is better, the new or the old one. While the 80/20 ratio is low risk because if the new format is not good, we will lose only 20% of users. But because the ratio is low, we cannot quickly measure which is better. We may have to experiment again by increasing the ratio for the new format to be more certain. Think of Hamtube as a big platform and the purpose of using the app is not to watch ads. Therefore, there is no need to rush to collect data and no need to rush to take a big risk. Therefore, we should use the 80/20 ratio."
13,Hamtaro should use A/B testing because A/B testing can accurately measure the effect of ad placement shifts (if the split ratio is appropriate) by dividing the sample into two groups and testing.
14,"Agree, because this experiment is a Bernoulli distribution (there are only clicks on ads and no clicks), where each Bernoulli belongs to a specific user, and when combined, each user is independent, making it a Binomial distribution."
15,Agree because the position of the ad affects the chance of the ad being clicked. 
16,"Granularity should be the number of ad clicks per ad impression, because if the repositioning really works better, the ratio of granularity should also increase (more people click). Attribution period should be short, such as 30 seconds, based on the ad duration of around 30 seconds to see that if users really like to watch the ad, they should click from the moment they see it. Therefore, the attribution period should not be long."
17,"It should be because A/B testing allows Hamtaro to test the effect of a single change (in this case, the ad position) by comparing it to a control group that makes no changes (but you have to choose the right metric to measure, such as using click-through rate as the metric according to the problem)."
18,"50/50 may give faster results but there is a risk that most viewers will dislike the new format and it will affect the overall ad. Therefore, 80/20 is recommended because it is less risky and analysis has shown that 80/20 gives better results."
19,Agree because the possibility of clicking on an ad is just a click or a non-click.
20,"50/50: Collect data faster, but with higher risk because if the new layout is much worse, there will be more effective users and it will affect the ad revenue. 80/20: Collect data slower because the new layout that is only seen by 20% will require a lot of people to reach the target, but with lower risk because we can stop the experiment if we see any problems, be it bugs or the layout itself is not good. 80/20 is more suitable because it affects important stakeholders such as the people who buy ads directly. If there is a mistake, it will reduce the credibility of our product with the people who buy ads, causing people to buy less."
21,"Granularity -&gt; If Hamtaro wants to examine how moving an ad&#39;s location affects clicks from users in different areas of the site. So, a high granularity (e.g. by site area) might be a good choice, as it gives Hamtaro a detailed understanding of the impact of moving an ad&#39;s location across all areas. However, if Hamtaro chooses too high a granularity, he might miss out on important information that could influence his decision. Attribution Period -&gt; A short period of time (e.g. 7 days), as Hamtaro wants to know how users react immediately after seeing an ad in a new location."
22,Agree. The reasons are: 1. Easy to understand. 2. The result (click or not click) is binary. 3. Efficiency and speed of calculation due to the large data size.
23,"The number of times users see the ad because we will test how many clicked the ad from all users who saw it. The attribution period should be about 1 week because if it is too long, the number of clicks may decrease. However, if it is too short, the data may not be reliable."
24,"Granularity should be the number of users who click on ads and have an attribution period of 1 day. The granularity is chosen as the number of users because it is a measure that matches the objective of increasing sales and can be easily done in practice, such as installing Google Analytics. The period is 1 day because if the time is too short, you may get biased data such as branding or if it is too long, it may be caused by users clicking randomly without intending to."
25,"50/50 Quick conclusion in exchange for high risk that if B is worse than A, it will result in a disadvantage from the fact that A is already good. 80/20 Slow conclusion in exchange for low risk that if B is worse than A, it will result in a disadvantage from the fact that A is already good. 50/50 Hamtaro wants fast results and is willing to accept the risk."
26,"50/50 ratio: It helps to see the results quickly whether they are good or bad, but it has a higher risk than 80/20 that if you change it, the results will not be good, it may result in lower sales. 80/20 ratio: It has a relatively low risk because it is rare to see a new change. If we know that it is not good, it can be easily fixed. But the disadvantage is that it takes a long time to see the results of the new ad position. For the problem that is being found, the 80/20 ratio test may be a better choice because it will help to see the trend of change faster, while still maintaining careful work. But finally, the observation that requires time effectively must be analyzed to be reliable and fair in order to know whether the new version is really good.
"
27,"Hamtaro should use A/B testing because it allows Hamtaro to experiment with changes without having a significant impact on Hamtube users immediately if they don&#39;t get the results they expected after they&#39;re done, and it also helps to clearly see if the changes have an effect on more clicks on your ads."
28,"50/50 is faster but riskier as the new placement may have a negative impact on customers and also has the advantage of easy comparison since the number of users who saw the old placement and the number of users who saw the new placement are equal, so the data is available quickly. 80/20 is slower but riskier and does not impact the user experience as much. The 80/20 model seems to be more suitable for this problem because it is lower risk even though it is slower."
29,"Agree, because I want to know if moving the ad position to increase sales is effective compared to the original position and for such cases, using a/b testing will make it easier to draw conclusions."
30,"Disagree: Due to the limitations of binomial distribution, if an experiment needs to analyze results from complex data (e.g. time spent on the platform or user engagement patterns), binomial distribution may not be sufficient to capture such complex data. "
31,A/B testing will help us tell whether the &quot;new&quot; or &quot;old&quot; product that Hamtaro will place the ad on will increase sales more. Because A/B testing is a statistical hypothesis testing to tell according to statistics whether the new product is better or not.
32,"50-50 model Advantages - Easy analysis since sample size is same, less bias - If load balancing is used, 50-50 will not be as heavy as weighted model. Disadvantages - If ads don&#39;t work, that means 50% of people will experience the change, which may lead to negative effects such as more word of mouth. - Resource management requires more resources to migrate. 80-20 model is like reversing 50-50. Advantages - Less negative effects since only 20% of people will experience the change. - Easier mitigation, more economical. Disadvantages - Less statistical power - Bias because fewer people will not be representative. If Hamtube has a lot of traffic, is a reputation-sensitive site, and has enough capital and resources, I would choose 50-50. Otherwise just pick 80-20 as it is safer. "
33,"Yes, A/B testing is an effective way to evaluate the results of changes between two options (A and B) without external variables influencing the outcome. In the context of a retailer testing the relocation of an advertisement, employing A/B testing enables a clear and immediate assessment of whether this change impacts sales or not."
34,"Agree because - The data is binary (pressed/unpressed) which is consistent with the use of binomial dist - Binomial dist can be calculated quickly, making it easy to understand the results - Binomail allows the calculation of confidence intervals"
35,"The 50/50 option is to choose a higher proportion of ads in the new location, which will result in a much shorter testing period since the results will be faster because there will be more ads in the new location. However, the main disadvantage is that it is more risky because if the ad placement change is not effective, it will lose a lot of sales from the test. On the 80/2 side, the test will be slower because there is a smaller proportion of ads in the new location, but it is also less risky because there is a higher proportion of ads in the original location that have known sales. In Hamtube&#39;s A/B testing problem, the 80/20 option is more appropriate because ads are a source of high revenue for the platform. Moving the ad placement may result in an increase in disliked users, which can significantly reduce sales."
36,"Granularity = The number of times a user clicks on an ad, to measure whether users click on an ad more if the position changes. Attribution period = 1 week. Consider an attribution period that is not too long to allow for quick response and adjustment when results are seen.
"
37,I agree with Hamtaro because Binomial Distribution is suitable for A/B testing with two possible outcomes (e.g. click or no click) and helps in calculating the probability of the outcome.
38,"Advantages - It allows for a precise comparison of the results of both versions because the number of viewers who saw each version is the same. It reduces bias in the experiment because all viewers had the same chance to see both versions. - It takes less time to experiment than the 50/50 ratio because it allows for a sufficient number of samples to compare the results faster. Disadvantages - It may take a long time to experiment because it takes longer to get a sufficient number of samples to compare the results. Advantages and disadvantages of choosing the 80/20 ratio - It may result in inaccurate results because the number of viewers who saw each version is not the same, which may cause the results of the two versions to differ by chance. Conclusion - From the advantages and disadvantages of both ratios, it can be seen that the 50/50 ratio gives more accurate results but takes longer to experiment. The 80/20 ratio takes less time to experiment but may result in inaccurate results. - If Hamtaro wants the most accurate results, choosing the 50/50 ratio would be a better choice. However, if Hamtaro wants to save time in the experiment, choosing the 80/20 ratio would be a better choice. - In the case of Hamtaro who wants to test changes in the placement of ads, which may affect viewer behavior in the long term, I recommend choosing the 50/50 ratio to make the experiment results as accurate and comprehensive as possible."
39,"A/B testing should be used in testing because we want to test between the original ad position and the new ad position to see if the ad position actually affects sales, so it is appropriate to use A/B testing."
40,"Depending on the size of the channel, the risk that Hamtaro is willing to take "
41,"50/50 has the advantage of speed since both groups are the same size, so data can be collected from both groups quickly. However, the disadvantage is that half of the users will see the changes. If the changes cause any problems, it will increase the risk to the platform. 80/20 has the advantage of only 20% of the users will see the changes, so it can reduce the risk of any problems from the changes. However, the disadvantage is that it takes longer than 50/50 because the number of users who see the changes is much different from the number of users who use the old model. Therefore, it will take more time to collect enough data from the users. For this problem, 80/20 is more appropriate because the problem is not urgent and is related to sales, so it should not cause more risk than necessary."
42,"50/50 will allow for a full sample collection faster, but also carries a higher risk of losing clicks from Group B, compared to 20/80, which is less risky but takes longer to collect. Since clicks may affect the advertising revenue on hamtube, and there is no rush to reach a verdict, the 80/20 split is more appropriate."
43,"Agreed, because A/B testing is often used to test things, requiring an initial reference and a new interface change, by testing it on real user experiences to test those hypotheses, which is in line with the need to test new ad placements, while still having the old one and not exceeding the limitations of using A/B testing."
44,I agree that A/B Testing should be used because it is better to test whether the ad will stay in the same place or move.
45, Agree because clicking or not clicking on an ad can be a success or failure (0/1)
46,"It is not suitable because if we want to measure other outcomes that are not clicks, such as time spent on the platform, share clicks, etc., the binomial distribution will not meet the requirements."
47,"The advantage of 50/50 is that Hamtaro will have an equal number of users testing both cases, making the results closer to the truth than 80/20. But the disadvantage is that Hamtaro will have a higher risk in testing if the new ad placement is not successful. Here, we will choose to use the 50/50 ratio because we see that each user has variables that will suppress the ad placement in the new position that are very different. Therefore, we should use more samples in the experiment to get a close value because advertising is an important part that should be studied clearly for long-term use."
48,Bernoulli changed the number of times people clicked on an ad in a sample group.
49," The 50/50 split takes less time to experiment than the 80/20 split because it has a larger sample size of users who experience the ad repositioning. However, the 50/50 split is riskier than the 80/20 split because there is a chance that users will dislike Hamtube&#39;s change and it will have a negative impact on the product&#39;s image. The 50/50 split is better because it takes less time to decide whether the ad repositioning will increase the number of clicks on the ad. As for the risk of users disliking the change, the ad repositioning should not have a negative impact on users enough to damage Hamtube&#39;s image.
"
50,"50/50 Advantages: - Balance: Equal grouping of users results in balanced and easily comparable data. - Speed: Data is obtained quickly and sufficient for analysis and decision-making. Disadvantages: - Impact: If the change is negative, it will affect a large number of people. 80/20 Advantages: - Low risk: If the change is negative, it will affect a small number of people. - Easy to test: New ideas or innovations can be easily tested without affecting a large number of people. Disadvantages: - Slow: It takes a long time to collect data to obtain significant data. - Insufficient data: Due to the small number of subjects, time is limited, so the data collected will be too little. Conclusion: 80/20 because it can reduce the negative risk that may affect a large number of people, but it is necessary to have enough time to collect data."
51,"Agree because we can see whether users click or not on the ad, which is consistent with the binomial distribution. By choosing the binomial distribution, we can calculate various statistical values from the data."
52,"Hamtaro should use A/B testing because it will allow him to see whether moving the ad position affects sales or not, regardless of other confounders."
53,"50/50 Ratio: Advantages: It is a dedicated test because both groups are given equal exposure to both ad placements: The 50/50 ratio allows both the control variable (old placement) and the experimental variable (new placement) to be tested equally. This can help Hamtaro get equal data to analyze the results. Disadvantages: It does not check whether the change has a significant effect: Choosing a 50/50 ratio may not be able to check whether the ad placement change has a significant effect because both groups are tested equally. 80/20 Ratio: Advantages: More weight given to the experimental group: In this case, 80% of the users will see the ad at the new location, which can help Hamtaro collect more significant data than the remaining group. Disadvantages: It is not tested equally: Giving more weight to the experimental group (80%) can cause the results to be influenced more by this group, which may result in inequitable results for the control group. Appropriateness: Which ratio is appropriate to choose depends on the objectives and questions that Hamtaro wants to answer. If the goal is to test whether the ad placement change has a significant effect, choosing a 50/50 ratio is a good choice. But if Hamtaro wants to collect more significant data from the experimental group, the 80/20 ratio might be a good choice, to give more weight to the experimental group of interest."
54,"50/50 will allow us to compare the results of clicking on the ad of the old and new positions equally, but 50/50 will prevent us from examining the effects of other uncontrollable variables, such as the personal preferences of the testers. 80/20 will allow the results of changing the button position to be based on the preferences of the majority of people, making the results of this change more reliable than the 50/50 method. However, 80/20 will make the comparison of the results of the change and non-change groups more complicated because the sample groups are not equal. I think Hamtaro should choose the 80/20 method to get the most likely data from the sample group, but it may need to collect more data for analysis to be highly reliable."
55,"80/20 because it is safer in case the new ads do not work and affect the usage and his boss does not rush to submit the conclusion soon, so it can be done gradually."
56,I agree with using Binomial Distribution because clicking on an ad has two outcomes (click or not click) which makes it suitable to use Binomial distribution and Binomial distribution makes it easy to calculate probability and compare outcomes between two groups.
57,"Choosing a 50/50 split cause &quot;Investing involves risks, so let&#39;s embrace it&quot;. It&#39;s a faster approach, though less secure. On the other hand, an 80/20 split is play safe way, prioritizing security over speed."
58,"Agree because the result of one experiment, what we are interested in is click or not click."
59,"A/B testing is essential for Hamtaro’s marketing team on the Hamtube platform to compare the results of moving ads to a new location with the original location. This method provides reliable data by randomly assigning users to a control group and an experimental group, giving a clear picture of the effectiveness of the change. A/B testing reduces business risk by testing the results before implementing the change on every user, reducing uncertainty and helping to adjust both immediate and long-term marketing plans based on the data, thus adapting and improving Hamtaro’s marketing plans on the platform."
60,"Granularity should be ads clicked/ unique user because ads clicked/ unique user shows how much the average user clicks on ads. Attribution period should be 1 day per session because when watching a video, users are more interested in videos than ads (no one wants to watch ads). So I assume that no new user will remember the ads from the previous day."
61,"Agree with Hamtaro that he chose to use binomial distribution to replace the distribution of A/B testing this time because binomial distribution follows the assumptions of A/B testing as follows: - There are a fixed number of experiments. - Each experiment is independent of each other. - The results of each experiment are independent of each other. - The results of the experiment are only 2 outcomes: success or failure. In Hamtaro&#39;s case, there are a fixed number of experiments, which is 1 month. Each experiment that the viewer sees the ad is independent of each other. And the result of each experiment is whether the viewer clicks the ad or not. Therefore, binomial distribution is suitable to replace the distribution of A/B testing this time."
62,"Agreed, because we can model our experiment as the likelihood of clicking ads, which is a discrete event with only two outcomes: click or not, and we collect data multiple times, which fits the definition of a binomial distribution."
63,"I agree with Hamtaro because if we look at the chance of users clicking on an ad as a success chance and doing it many times, it will be like a binary distribution."
64,"Agree because the number of times or click rate is always an integer, so a binomial distribution can be used to show the distribution of data."
65,"The 50/50 ratio can provide faster data flow compared to the 80/20 ratio, but it is more prone to misleading conclusions (current trends, seasonality, major events). Therefore, the 80/20 ratio is preferred because we want to know whether users click on more ads in the long run (no misleading conclusions)."
66,"Granularity cookies per 1 day attribution period should be 1 day, which is an appropriate period of time for user browsing and purchasing. It should not be too short or too long (depending on the type of product being advertised). If it is too short, users will have already viewed the product and not choose to view it, but it will still be counted."
67,"Binomial distribution is a probability distribution of an experiment with only two outcomes. When there are only two outcomes of interest, such as clicking or not clicking on an ad, the assumption that each outcome is independent, and there are enough experiments to use the Binomial distribution to estimate the probability of the outcome. The reason why using the Binomial distribution is a good choice may lie in the suitability of the statistical model to the experiment and the available data. However, it should be noted that there are limitations, such as the assumption that each outcome is independent, which is not true in some cases, and the potential for more complex calculations or analyses. The decision to use the Binomial distribution should be based on the nature of the data, the experiments available, and the suitability of the statistical model used. Theory and practice should be considered to make decisions about data analysis as reasonable and accurate as possible."
68,"Agreed, because A/B Testing is good for comparing the results (in this case, the number of times users click on an ad) of two actions, in this case, moving the ad position and not moving the ad position."
69,"I disagree because clicks are not independent of each event, as users who have clicked on an ad may behave differently than before they clicked."
70,"A/B testing should be used to test the placement of ads in Hamtube. A/B testing allows Hamtaro to see the impact of the placement of ads, adjust the variables being tested, and also allows Hamtaro to choose the best option.
"
71,"Using the binomial distribution in Hamtaro&#39;s A/B testing can be an appropriate choice because 1. It is a Bernouli&#39;s addition, and 2. The binomial distribution is suitable for data that has only two outcomes, such as &quot;click&quot; or &quot;no click&quot; on an ad. If Hamtaro&#39;s A/B testing experiment focuses on measuring the number of ad clicks, then using the binomial distribution is appropriate."
72,"Choosing the proportion of users exposed to the old and new placements has implications for A/B testing. The advantage of a 50/50 ratio is that it offers a win-win test with no transition lag, while an 80/20 ratio can help create new comparisons between variables and experiments without requiring a large number of users to be exposed to the new ad immediately. The disadvantage of an 80/20 ratio is that experiments can take longer to gather significant data for analysis and precision. The choice of the right ratio will depend on the needs of the experiment and the goals of the experiment, so a 50/50 ratio would be more appropriate for this problem, as it offers a win-win test with no transition lag."
73,"Hamtaro should use A/B testing because it allows Hamtaro to gather data on how users interact with different ad placements, allowing him to make informed decisions based on real user behavior. It also provides tangible evidence of the impact of ad placement changes on user interactions."
74,"Advantages of 50/50 - It provides balanced, equal data from both groups and allows for a fair comparison, reducing the risk of randomization error. Advantages of 80/20 - If there is concern about possible effects of the experiment, using a proportion that is biased towards the old position (80%) will reduce the risk. It is considered better to use 80/20 since it is the option that affects fewer users who click and therefore is the less risky approach."
75,"Hamtaro should consider using the binomial distribution for A/B testing. Here are the reasons. 1. Binary Outcome: The binomial distribution is well-suited for scenarios where there are only two possible outcomes for each trial, in this case, whether a user clicks on an ad or not. This aligns with the nature of click-through rate (CTR) measurements in A/B testing. 2. Independent Trials: The trials in A/B testing are typically independent, meaning that the outcome of one user&#39;s interaction with the platform does not affect the outcome of another user&#39;s interaction. The binomial distribution assumes independence between trials. 3. Fixed Number of Trials: A/B testing involves a fixed number of trials (users exposed to version A or B), and the binomial distribution is appropriate for situations where the number of trials is predetermined. 4. Simple and Well-Understood: The binomial distribution is a simple and well-understood probability distribution, making it easy to calculate probabilities and conduct statistical tests. This simplicity is advantageous for practical implementation in A/B testing scenarios."
76,"Ranularity should be at an appropriate level that allows results to be examined in a period that is not too short or too long. It should not be selected at a level that is too small to be able to compare changes, or it should be selected at a level that is too large to be difficult to analyze. Attribution period should be selected at an appropriate period of time according to the nature of the business and the usage pattern that Hamtaro uses in order to obtain data that reflects the reality of the results well enough."
77,"I agree because pressing has 2 events: pressing or not pressing, which is in line with the binary principle of doing or not doing."
78,"It should be Hits/Impressions and the attribution period should be one-min attribution because Hamtaro wants to know if the ad is clicked, which is something that if seen, people can immediately decide whether to click or ignore it. Therefore, having the granularity as Hits/Impressions is appropriate for the ad to be seen because people who see it and like it should click from the first time. There are not many people who see it and then go back to click."
79,"I agree with the use of A/B testing for testing the placement of ads on Hamtube, because there are important reasons for making marketing decisions: 1. User behavior: Different users in different situations may have different behaviors towards ads. For example, users in the part where the ad is shown may have different interests. A/B testing helps to understand the behavior of users in different situations and their responses to ads in detail. 2. Spatial marketing planning: A/B testing that places ads in different locations on the platform gives a comprehensive picture of the areas that affect ad response. 3. User customization: A/B testing helps to understand the preferences of users and how each group has different interests, so that marketing can be tailored to the target group effectively. A/B testing is a good way to thoroughly examine and adjust marketing for different users and environments. This way of checking will give Hemtaro the information he needs to make decisions to adjust his marketing plan with more confidence."
80,It is easy to define relevant metrics and clearly divide them into two assumptions.
81,"The granularity should be the number of times the video is viewed so that it can be compared to ad clicks, and the attribution period should be around 1 day."
82,It is the number of times ads are shown. The length of the attribution period is 1 day to check if users click on ads within 1 day.
83,I agree with using A/B testing in testing because it is a problem that can be easily divided into control and experimental groups by simply changing the UI of the user who accesses the website. 
84,"User Level: Setting granularity at the user level can provide very detailed information about individual behavior, making it easier to tailor marketing strategies to the needs of the target audience. Channel Level: Gathering data at the channel level can help you understand the performance of individual marketing channels, allowing you to tailor marketing strategies to each channel. Campaign Level: Setting granularity at the campaign level can provide an overview of the performance of different campaigns and help you analyze the results of all marketing activities. The attribution period should be based on the nature of your business and your customers’ behavioral patterns. If your business has customers who need a long time to make a decision, the attribution period should be long enough to cover this process. If your customers have a fast-moving behavior pattern, a shorter attribution period may be sufficient to analyze and adjust your marketing strategy. This period should be set in line with your marketing and business objectives."
85,"It should be used in a session format, with the length of the attribution period being around 15 minutes - 30 minutes, compared to the clicks in that session, for example, if clicked in that session, count as 1, if not, count as 0. The design is this way because most of the things that are placed in ads like this are probably not very expensive and the user can make a decision in a short period of time. If given more time, it is possible that the user clicking in may not be because of the ads, but may be due to other variables, such as buying according to friends, etc."
86,"Use A/B testing because it is a test with a group that saw the ad in the original position and saw the ad in the new position, which is divided into two groups and can conclude which one creates better sales."
87,"Click on all ads, all views to see how many people have viewed it in a day."
88,"50/50 Advantages: Easy and clear division, doesn&#39;t take long to collect sample size, testing can be done quickly. Disadvantages: High risk, may cause a lot of loss if the new advertising format makes less profit. 80/20: Advantages: Lower risk, not much loss if the new advertising format makes less profit. Disadvantages: Small sample size, needs much longer collection time. Assuming that hamtube is a fairly large company with many users, it must make the risk of loss low, so it&#39;s better to use 80/20."
89,"The granularity should be #click/#cookie-days, each cookie is a Bernoulli trial, and the attribution period should be 1 day because most people spend less than 1 day watching a video."
90,"A/B testing should be used because A/B testing is designed to test the old (A) and new (B) versions of an ad, in this case whether the new ad placement has an effect."
91,"It should be done because A/B Testing will result in 1. Data-Driven Decisions, not &quot;guessing&quot; and 2. Risk Mitigation. Changing the placement of all ads may cause the business results to drop. A/B testing will allow you to try with some customer groups to see if it works or not. In addition, you will get User Behaviour that Users tend to press which buttons or where to put things, whether they can be found or not. It can be used for other things besides Ads."
92,"A/B testing is a test of only two hypotheses (new ad position does not increase sales vs. new ad position increases sales), which is appropriate for this problem."
93,"Agreed, because this experiment has only one possible outcome: click or no click, which fits a binomial distribution, with only one possible outcome: success or failure."
94,"I agree because 1. It is a test of 2 different groups and we want to test which test gives better results. 2. In the experiment, there may be other things that affect our experiment, which is something called Randomness, because the experiment must involve many other factors that we cannot control. Therefore, using A/B test is appropriate by keeping all factors constant. The outcome will depend only on the position of the ad and Randomness. "
95,A/B testing is an ideal tool for testing ad placement changes to measure their impact on user clicks on your ads. This experiment allows Hamtaro to compare results between a group of users who saw the ad in the old position (the control group) and a group who saw the ad in the new position (the experiment group). The advantage of this method is the ability to assess the impact of a specific change while minimizing the impact of external factors.
96,"50/50 Ratio Advantages: An experiment is an experiment in which all items have an equal chance of being shown the new or old placement. This allows for comparable data in both situations. Disadvantages: The results are not immediate if there is a difference in results because there may be users with different behaviors. 80/20 Ratio Advantages: The experiment can provide immediate results and the results are available from a larger number of users who are exposed to the new placement, reducing uncertainty in decision-making. Disadvantages: The experiment may have skewed results if the results are shown to users who are more popular or have a higher chance of switching. The choice of ratio depends on the purpose of the experiment. If Hamtaro wants data from all user groups, a 50/50 ratio might be appropriate. However, if immediate results are needed and resources are limited, an 80/20 ratio might be a good choice because it allows for more efficient and effective data collection from a more likely group."
97,"I agree that Hamtaro uses A/B testing because what Hamtaro wants to know is whether moving the ad position will increase sales (more users click on the ad), and A/B testing is just two different versions of testing."
98,"Using a 50/50 split can collect more data, which allows for a shorter experiment, but there is a greater risk of a drop in sales since most users do not like this split. An 80/20 split can collect less data, which allows for a longer experiment, but there is a lower risk of a drop in sales since it is tested with fewer users. In this case, the 80/20 split should be used because it is possible that changing the ad position will cause a large drop in sales, and it is also important to see whether the increase in sales is due to the new group or the same group, since it is possible that the new group is just a fad, which may not actually increase sales."
99,"A/B Testing is recommended because it involves testing two audiences, seeing different ad placements, and determining which placement is more effective."
100,"Granularity A/B testing should be done at the individual user level to allow detailed analysis of the data and understanding of the target audience&#39;s behavior. The attribution period should be long enough to capture the true impact of changes in ad placement without eliminating potentially relevant data, such as 30 days."
101,A/B testing should be used because it is a comparison of two versions of an app page with different ad placements to find out which ads users click on more by collecting data and doing A/B testing and then concluding the results.
102,Reasons why Hamtaro should use A/B testing: 1. Save time and resources: A/B testing requires less cost and resources because it does not require testing on every user. 2. Reliable data: A/B testing helps to provide reliable data by comparing the changed group with the unchanged group.
103,"Granularity: user id because it is unique and some users may come to view repeatedly, which may cause the count to be over. Attribution period: 1 day because users are likely to come to view once a day and seeing the ad is a short time before deciding to click, so the attribution period should not be set to be too long."
104,"A 50/50 ratio will provide balanced data and a fair comparison between the two groups, but it may take longer to accumulate statistically significant data. An 80/20 ratio is useful where the impact on user experience is most likely to be minimized, but it may expose the data to greater risk of statistical error due to the smaller sample size. Choosing the right ratio depends on how flexible Hamtaro is to accept risks and the goals of the experiment."
105,"Using a binomial distribution is suitable to replace the distribution of A/B testing because it measures the probability of an ad click / no click. If measuring only one user, it will be a bernoulli distribution. But when counting all users in Hamtube, the total bernoulli will be a binomial distribution where all users are independent. "
106,"Assumption: People click on ads = get money Granularity: Use only hits because it doesn&#39;t matter who clicks, only cares about how many clicks Attribution period: 1 day because it&#39;s so easy to click ads"
107,"A/B testing is the right way for Hamtaro to test the placement of his ads on Hamtube for the following main reasons: 1. Evidence-based decision-making: A/B testing allows Hamtaro to make informed decisions. Comparing the results between the group that saw the ad in the original position (Group A) and the group that saw the ad in the new position (Group B) allows him to see how the change affects the clicks on his ads. 2. Controlling for noise: A/B testing provides the ability to control for noise and other variables that may affect the results. By randomly allocating users to each group, Hamtaro can be sure that the results are solely the result of the change in ad placement. 3. Accurate measurement: A/B testing allows Hamtaro to clearly and precisely measure the impact of the change. He can check whether the clicks on his ads increase and to what extent. 4. Risk reduction: Testing on a small scale before making a large-scale change reduces the risk of making a decision that may negatively affect the user experience or profitability. 5. Ability to continuously improve: The results from A/B testing can be used to continuously develop and improve the platform. If the change does not work, Hamtaro can experiment with new approaches."
108,- Can directly measure the effect of ad repositioning - Can tell whether ad repositioning has an effect on sales
109,I agree with using bernoulli because we have 2 possible scenarios: press and don&#39;t press the ad.
110,"A/B testing can be used in testing because we have metrics to measure the results, and this test is a test between the original (old ad position) and the new (new ad position)."
111,"This is appropriate because the Binomial distribution is suitable for experiments with only two outcomes (success or failure), and this A/B testing experiment has two outcomes: click on the ad or no click on the ad, which fits the characteristics of the Binomial distribution."
112,"A/B testing allows Hamtaro to test changes in ad placements against a control group that does not make changes, allowing him to determine whether moving ad placements would have an impact on sales and providing him with statistically sound data to make informed decisions about how to adjust his marketing plans."
113,"The advantage of using a 50/50 ratio is that it can work faster, but in exchange for the disadvantage that the risk of users not liking the move to a new ad is higher. The advantage of using an 80/20 ratio is that the risk of users not liking it is lower, but in exchange for it taking longer to collect data. Personally, I think using a 50/50 is better because moving the ad doesn&#39;t have much effect on users, and for increasing sales, the faster the data can be collected, the better."
114,"Agreed, because the outcome Hamtaro is interested in is &quot;Did the user click on the ad?&quot;, which is a binary value."
115,"50/50 Advantages: The sample size of both groups is equal, making the comparison easier, clearer, and more reliable. Disadvantages: If this change has a negative impact, a lot of business opportunities will be lost during the experiment, because 50% of customers use the bad model during the experiment. 80/20 Advantages: Reduces the risk that the new ad position may have a negative impact on users, because only 20% of customers use it. Disadvantages: Less data will be obtained, making the statistical reliability less. This problem should be solved with 50/50 because it will get more statistically reliable data. The loss of business opportunities if the new results are not good is not important, because the attribution period of this experiment is only 7 days, making the impact very small compared to the data and opportunities that we will get."
116,"50/50 Pros: It is much faster to complete the experiment with the n people you set. Cons: If there is a problem with the newly created ad position experiment, the damage will be huge. 80/20 Pros: If there is a problem with the newly created ad position experiment, the damage will be much less than 50/50. Cons: It is still risky and the data is collected slowly. Choosing the most appropriate method depends on how big Hamtube is. If it is a small startup, 50/50 should be used to quickly increase sales. If it is a large company, 80/20 should be used, which should actually be less since it is just moving ads. You should accept the lowest risk and gradually collect a/b testing data to avoid huge losses."
117,"Granularity: # ads clicked/#total views shows how many people clicked on the ads. Attribute period: 1 day Because Hamtube is a website that people visit frequently, it should not have a period of time that is too long."
118,"50/50 model Advantages: Equal experimentation, not focusing too much on any one position. Disadvantages: Can&#39;t see the impact of having a new position. 80/20 model Advantages: Can gradually test user behavior in changing positions, low risk. Disadvantages: Unequal proportion, low chance of seeing ads in the new position. I think 80/20 model is better, in order to see user behavior, find consistency between the old and new positions while doing testing, which will be useful for future testing."
119,"50/50: It takes less time to collect data, but there is more risk from placing ads in new positions. 80/20: It takes more time to collect data, but there is less risk from placing ads in new positions. Answer: 50/50 because the risk from placing ads in new positions is not significant. Hamtube users use the platform primarily to watch online videos, not to watch ads. Placing ads is unlikely to have much of an impact on users&#39; experience, so they can accept a greater risk from placing ads."
120,"Agree because - It is data driven insight, meaning there is real data to support the decision, not just feelings. - A/B testing is comparing two (or more) versions of a variable, with the same control variables, which is the case in this situation. However, the samples of both versions must be the same and must represent the population."
121,It should be used because using A/B testing can reduce risk and measure business results when comparing results A to B.
122,- Granularity should be session level to see if ad position shifting causes clicks in each session. - Attributution period should be 1-3 months to see if ad position shifting causes clicks in the long run.
123,"It is appropriate because there are other factors that affect sales, such as the advertising clip at that time, the popularity of society at that time, the social trends at that time, the country&#39;s finances at that time, which makes it acceptable to use A/B testing. "
124,"1. Data-Driven Decision Making: A/B testing provides concrete data on user behavior and preferences. It allows Hamtaro to make decisions based on evidence rather than assumptions. 2. Identifying Causation: A/B testing helps establish a causal relationship between changes made (moving the ads) and the observed outcomes (click-through rates, revenue). This is crucial for understanding the true impact of the change. 3. Optimizing User Experience: By testing different ad positions, Hamtaro can identify the placement that enhances the user experience and encourages higher engagement. This is important for long-term user satisfaction. 4. Maximizing Revenue: Ultimately, the goal is to increase revenue. A/B testing allows Hamtaro to fine-tune the platform for maximum profitability by identifying the most effective ad placement."
125,"Granularity should be the number of ad clicks a user gets in each session to measure whether ad placement influences click-off. Attribution period should be 1-4 weeks, as this is not too little time to collect data from users and not too much time to be disturbed by external factors."
126,Should use bernoulli more than just click to view or not click to view
127,A/B test is suitable because it can clearly analyze the impact of this change on sales. It reduces the risk of impact on sales. It is reliable because the variables are well controlled and the results are accurately measured.
128,"Agree, because if we want to measure whether users click on ads more or not, we should count the number of clicks, which each person will have only one case of click (success) and no click (failure), which is a bernoulli distribution. So when this event occurs in many people who are independent, it will be a binomial distribution."
129,"Agree because each person&#39;s probability is Bernoulli and when combined, it becomes a Binomial Distribution."
130,Agree because - It is suitable for experiments with only two outcomes (click or no click) - It is easy to calculate and has a clear formula for calculating the probability of the outcome - It is suitable for experiments with equal proportions and independent experiments - It is flexible to apply to experiments with different sample sizes.
131,"The 50/50 method takes a shorter trial period but has a higher chance of affecting your overall income. The 80/20 method takes a longer period but has a lower chance of affecting your overall income. I chose the 50/50 method because the trial period mentioned above is 2 weeks, which is not that long and the results are fast."
132,"Choosing a 50/50 split means equally distributing users between the two test groups, which should give a balanced view of user interactions with the ads. An 80/20 split would mean one group is larger than the other, which could introduce bias into the test results. For Hamtube, a 50/50 split is typically more reliable for understanding the true impact of ad placement changes."
133,"Agree, because the binomial distribution is suitable for analyzing data that has 2 types, where A/B testing will result in one of two outcomes, such as click or no click, making the binomial distribution suitable for A/B testing."
134,"It is appropriate because in this A/B Testing, the only result is whether people come to see, click or not. Therefore, using a binomial distribution, which is a continuous bernoulli, is appropriate."
135,"Agreed, as it is appropriate for situations involving binary outcomes, such as user clicks on ads."
136,Agree because it measures the chance of clicking or not clicking on the ad in that location.
137,"50/50 Advantages Allows Hamtaro to immediately test ad structures in both placements against each other. Disadvantages Testing the same proportion may not give Hamtaro enough data to adjust the proportions further. 80/20 Advantages Allows more new ads to be tested, allowing for a wider examination of the effects of the new ad structure. Disadvantages Testing a larger proportion of new ads may bias the old ads, making it impossible to properly analyze the effects of the old ad structure. 80/20 is more appropriate for new ads to test."
138,"I agree with using A/B Testing because A/B Testing is suitable for comparing 2 things, for example in this case, let&#39;s say ad position A or ad position B, which one has better user engagement."
139,"Agree because each person has a chance to press or not press, it is a Bernoulli distribution. When we consider the sample size n, the distribution is in the form of a binomial distribution."
140,"A/B testing is a useful process for testing hypotheses or changes in marketing. Hamtaro should use A/B testing to test whether moving the position of his ads will affect their clicks or sales. This test gives him clear information about the effect of the change, which allows him to make informed decisions on adjusting Hamtube&#39;s marketing accordingly."
141,"Agreed, because we can view the problem as having p chances of users clicking on an ad in each session. If we view the problem in this way, we can view the distribution of the number of times users click on an ad as Binomial([number of sessions], p)."
142,"- 50/50 ratio: The advantage is that the experiment is balanced and easy to analyze. The disadvantage is that it may not reflect the real-world conditions of all users. - 80/20 ratio: The advantage is that the experiment may better reflect the behavior of users in a real-world environment. The disadvantage is that it may be difficult to detect differences in results between the two groups. For Hamtaro, the choice of ratio depends on the purpose of the experiment and the importance of reflecting reality in the experiment. If the goal is to conduct the experiment in a more controlled environment, the 50/50 ratio may be more appropriate. But if data that reflects the real-world behavior of users in a real-world environment is desired, the 80/20 ratio may be a better choice."
143,"I don&#39;t quite agree, especially when the data is complex and requires very detailed analysis. This is because the binomial distribution is often used to count only two possible outcomes (such as success or failure or heads or tails). However, in A/B Testing, there can be many variables that affect the outcome, such as the frequency of clicks on ads, the time spent viewing ads for each ad type."
144,"Why use it: A/B testing is a powerful tool for testing the impact of small changes on business results. In Hamtaro’s case, the experiment helped him assess whether changing the placement of his ads had an effect on click-through rates and user engagement. By splitting users into two groups (one group seeing the ad in the same location and the other group seeing the ad in a new location), Hamtaro was able to make meaningful comparisons. Con: If Hamtube’s market or user behavior is highly volatile, the results of the experiment may be inconsistent or inexhaustible. In this case, a more sophisticated approach, such as advanced statistical analysis or user insights, may be more appropriate."
145,"Granularity: Granularity should be chosen in line with how users interact with the ad. If the ad has high engagement (e.g. clicks), this helps Hamtaro better understand user behavior over a short period of time. Attribution Period: This period should be sufficient to cover the user&#39;s normal interactions with the ad and purchasing decisions."
146,"Total number of ad clicks, total number of visitors because it indicates how interested the viewer is in the ad. As for the attribution period, it should be 1 week because each day may affect the viewing, for example, Saturday/Sunday which are holidays may affect the number of clicks, so it should be calculated as 1 week."
147,"50/50 will give fast results but it is risky because if the positioning is not good, the audience will be very discouraged. 80/20 will take a long time to test because it requires high accuracy, but only a few viewers will see it. I personally recommend 80/20 because it gives more accurate results even though it takes a little longer."
148,"For 50/50, Advantages: Can balance between old and new, Can reach significance faster because the sample size of the new position is larger than 80/20. Disadvantages: Can take longer to detect the benefit because only 50% of the new position is accessed, ,More risky because more users are tested on the new position than 80/20. For 80/20, Advantages: Less risk than 50/50, Can capture the benefit faster because less proportion of new positions. Disadvantages: Does not balance between old and new positions, may bias the results, Can reach significance slower, may require longer testing. Answer: Use 80/20 because it reduces the risk that the new position may not be a good position, which reduces the revenue risk."
149,"50/50 has more statistical power but is more risky if the experiment fails. 80/20 has less statistical power but is less risky. I think the goal of the experiment is to increase sales, so sales should not be put at risk, so I choose 80/20."
150,"Agreed, since Hamtaro&#39;s experiment results in users clicking on ads (success) or not clicking (failure), it is suitable to use a binomial distribution. "
151,It should be done because he can easily collect data that is relevant to the test.
152,"Agreed, because we have already defined the proportion of users who saw the ad in the old position (A) and the new position (B), and what we want to find is the number of clicks/number of times each user saw the ad, so we should use binomial."
153,"Granularity should be the number of Unique User Ids that clicked to watch the video, since one person may watch the video repeatedly. Metric should be (#ad clicks)/(#Unique userid). Attribution Period should be 1 day, since it is assumed that viewers who watch the video will spend within 1 day anyway. "
154,"It should be used because A/B testing is a comparison of the combined effects of placing ads in a new location and in the original location to see if changing the location will affect user behavior. Hamtaro should use A/B testing because A/B testing allows for experiments that are based on solid data and evidence. This is because the comparison between the experimental group and the control group will clearly show the effects of changing the ad location. In addition, this experiment will allow us to see the results before implementing the changes to every user, which reduces business risks.
"
155,"Agree, because clicks or non-clicks on ads are a Bernoulli distribution, so the clicks or non-clicks of a large number of viewers are Bernoulli cycles, so it is a Binomial distribution."
156,"I would like to assume that Hamtube is a new business that does not have enough power to release a lot of new features. Therefore, I think that choosing 80/20 is more appropriate because it has low business risk. If this ad transfer causes the number of clicks on ads to decrease significantly, it will not have much negative impact on Hamtube. In exchange, it will take a long time to collect data from the 20% side. However, since Hamtube is not in a rush and does not have many other features to release for testing, a long time is not a problem. As for using 50/50, it has the advantage of time and can get data much faster than 80/20, but in exchange for higher risk. If no one clicks on 50 of B&#39;s ads, Hamtube will lose a lot of revenue."
157,1. A/B experiments allow you to control for other variables that might affect the outcome by comparing a treatment group to a control group. 2. A/B testing provides reliable data because it involves testing in a real environment where users work or interact with the product or service.
158,"granularity: user ids/reach attribution period: 30 days because it will allow for detailed analysis of each user&#39;s behavior, which will help increase understanding of the user. And choosing attribution period = 30 days because it allows time to observe the user&#39;s changed behavior during that period."
159,"Since what Hamtaro wants to do is move ad placement from A to B to test which placement will get more clicks, A/B testing, which is designed to test two different scenarios to see which is better, is very suitable."
160,"Granularity is the ratio between the number of people clicked on ads / the number of people seen ads. Attribution period is 7 days because in case of still using the same ads, the same people will remember and not click on the same ads again for about 1 week or within a week if they see it and it catches their attention but the first time they do not click on the ads within 1 week, when they see it repeatedly, it is possible that they will click to see it."
161,"50/50 Advantages - Faster results - Reduces potential biases from uncontrolled variables Disadvantages - Higher risk than 80/20 Advantages - Provides more meaningful data, allows for more efficient analysis of results - Lower risk Disadvantages - Takes longer to collect data from the test group, resulting in slower results 50/50 is the choice because business risk from ad placement is unlikely to be a concern, and faster results are more important."
162,"Using a binomial distribution in Hamtaro&#39;s A/B testing was a good decision, mainly because the test involved events that had a &quot;click&quot; or &quot;no click&quot; characteristic, which fits the binomial distribution&#39;s properties for handling events with two outcomes like this."
163,"Agreed, because A/B testing is similar to a scientific experiment with results that follow a typical binomial pattern."
164,"50/50 Ratio: Advantages: Choosing a 50/50 ratio allows the experiment to be neutral between showing the old and new ads in the new placements, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of the effects. Users do not have to spend a long time exposing the new and old ads. Disadvantages: An unbiased experiment may not be able to observe the effects of showing ads in different placements in sufficient detail. 80/20 Ratio: Advantages: The risk of the experiment is low. Disadvantages: It takes longer for people to see the new placement. Consider a 50/50 ratio as a first step to test the overall effects of showing the new and old ads, and then adjust the ratio in the next experiment based on the results of the initial experiment. "
165,"Since our test only checks whether the user clicks on the ad or not (there are only 2 types: click and no click), using a binomial distribution is appropriate."
166,"50/50 ratio: Advantages: Fast results, balance in testing. Disadvantages: High risk if the new position does not work. 80/20 ratio: Advantages: Reduced risk, better control of the situation. Disadvantages: Slow data collection, high variability. The choice depends on the risk tolerance and the urgency of getting results. If you accept the risk and want fast results, use 50/50. If you want to reduce the risk, use 80/20. For Hamtaro&#39;s problem in A/B testing a new ad position on Hamtube, the 50/50 ratio would be more appropriate because: Evaluate results quickly: Provides sufficient and fast information to evaluate the results of the change. Balance: Gives both positions an equal chance, allowing for a fair comparison. Reliability: The results from this ratio are highly reliable because each position is tested equally. Choosing this ratio will provide Hamtaro with accurate and comprehensive data to make better decisions."
167,"Disagree: Avoiding complexity: If the test has complex conditions and many variables that affect the results, using a more complex distribution may require more complex manipulation and calculations. Limitations in expressing the p-value: Using a binomial distribution may have limitations in expressing the p-value accurately, due to the limitations of sample size and large group sizes of the test. Using Normal Approximation: In the case of A/B testing, with a large enough sample size, using Normal Approximation can provide sufficient results to be used in calculating the p-value."
168,"Agreed, because the user&#39;s choices are binary, i.e. click and no click."
169,"Granularity should be #ads clicking event #cookies because clicking on ads in the same location and changing locations involves user learning. That is, if the user clicks in for the first time, they may not find it yet. But when they find it, the user will know that there is an ad here, which affects subsequent clicks that use cookies because it will cover all users, both logged in and not. Also, consider that placing ads on each device makes the user have to find a new location, so it should not be counted from device ids. Attribution Period should be 2 weeks, which will give the user time to become familiar with the ad placement."
170,"50/50 Model Advantages - Takes less time to test, because the sample group in each experiment is collected at the same rate. Disadvantages - There is a higher risk of business damage if the ad relocation method does not work well. 80/20 Model Advantages - There is a lower risk of business damage if the ad relocation method does not work well. Disadvantages - Takes more time to test, because the sample group in the ad relocation experiment is collected at a smaller rate. It is recommended that Hamtaro use the 80/20 model to avoid too much risk (assuming that Hamtube is a large platform)."
171,"Agree, because in this experiment, we are interested in the outcome which is divided into 2 parts: success and failure, and the variable in this experiment is the average of the litter rate from doing Bernoulli n times and finding the average, which is a binomial distribution n times."
172,"Granularity: The number of times a user clicks on an ad, and if the same ad is clicked, the number of times will not be counted. Attribution period: 1 hour, which is probably the time most people spend watching Hamtube."
173,"50/50 has a high risk because we have Type B (new ad placement) up to 50%, which if the result of Type B comes out bad, it will make the existing sales drop, but it has the advantage of collecting data quickly. As for 80/20, it is the opposite, it has the advantage of if the result of Type B comes out bad, it will not make the existing sales drop much, but it has the disadvantage of collecting data slowly. For this problem, I think using Type 50/50 is more appropriate because it gets data faster and moving the ad position does not cause much harm to the business."
174,"50/50 Advantages: It is more balanced and can be tested faster and shows better results than 80/20 because the numbers are similar. Disadvantages: It may have a big impact if the new format has problems and may have a negative effect on advertising revenue. 80/20 Advantages: There is a lower risk than 50/50 if the new format malfunctions or does not work well. Disadvantages: The data cannot be analyzed as well as 50/50 and it takes a long time to collect the data. I think the 80/20 ratio should be enough for this experiment where there is no rush to test and conclude the hypothesis.
"
175,"50/50 has the advantage of being able to have data sets of the same size, so it can provide sufficient information for decision making faster than 80/20. If there is a very good impact, it will have an effect quickly. The disadvantage is that if there is a high negative impact, it will have an impact greater than 80/20. 80/20 has the advantage of being safe, with low risk, if there is a very bad impact, it will have an impact on only 20%. The disadvantage is that it may take longer to obtain a sufficient data set than 50/50."
176,"50/50 Ratio Advantages: Balance: Allocating users equally to both groups results in balanced and easily comparable data. Speed of obtaining results: By allocating users equally, sufficient data can be obtained more quickly, allowing for faster analysis and decision-making. Disadvantages: Risk of large impact: If a change has a negative impact, it will affect a larger number of users. 80/20 Ratio Advantages: Less risk: Allocating more users to the control group (old positions) reduces the risk if the change is negative. Low-impact testing: New ideas can be tested without affecting the experience of the majority of users. Disadvantages: Slow to collect data: Allocating fewer users to the experimental group (new positions) takes longer to collect meaningful data. Potentially insufficient data: Not enough data may be obtained to conduct a reliable analysis. 80/20 Ratio reduces the risk of hamtube-related errors. If something goes wrong, the damage done is less."
177,"50/50 has the advantage of allowing the marketing team to test the new ad in a group of users that are the same size as the control group that saw the original ad, making the experiment more reliable and immediate. The disadvantage is that it may be slow to detect results because only 50% of users see the ad. The advantage of 80/20 is that most users will still see the old ad, which reduces the risk of users disliking the new ad. And if the 20% of users who see the new ad respond well, it can be used to increase sales. The disadvantage is that the measurement will be biased because most users still see the old ad. The 80/20 ratio is a good choice because it has a low risk of losing users and reduces risk in many ways."
178,"Using A/B testing to test the repositioning of ads on Hamtube is a great way to measure and verify whether this change can affect sales or user engagement. A/B testing allows Hamtaro to directly measure key business KPIs, such as sales, ad clicks, or platform engagement. Additionally, repositioning ads can have different effects than the theory behind Hamtaro’s hypothesis. Hamtaro can test this theory through A/B testing to see if it holds true. The results of A/B testing allow Hamtaro to refine and improve their marketing strategies as needed. If repositioning shows positive results, it can be used to develop further marketing plans."
179,"Agree because each user sees an ad and clicks on it each time, it is a Bernoulli distribution."
180,"A/B testing is recommended because it helps in making informed decisions about the results of comparing the group that saw the ad in the original position (Group A) and the group that saw the ad in the new position (Group B). It allows you to see the changes and has the ability to control for noise and other variables that may affect the results by randomly allocating users to each group, ensuring that the results are clearly and accurately the result of the change in ad position only. The results from A/B testing can be used to continuously develop and improve the platform if there are changes. But if this method does not work, you can try new approaches."
181,"Hamtaro should use A/B testing in testing because moving the position of the ad in Hamtube can measure which position is better or in this case, which position users will click on the ad more, which is related to increasing sales. By comparing between different positions through the same relevant factors/metrics, it will be possible to compare the difference in sales from moving the ad position."
182,"The 50/50 ratio should be used to test as many changes as possible without much statistical error, as this will provide more efficient data. However, the disadvantage is that using a 50/50 ratio can increase advertising costs while the results are unclear in the early stages of testing, as the new ad may not have as good a sales result as the old ad in some cases. However, if the test shows that the new ad is better than the 50/50, it will provide Hamtaro with efficient data to make better decisions about further changes."
183,"It is appropriate because it measures whether or not a user clicks on an ad based on how many times the user sees the ad, and it is discrete, making it a suitable and simple model to run A/B tests on."
184,"A/B testing allows Hamtaro to measure the effectiveness of his marketing campaigns in the most efficient way possible, in this case by moving the placement of his ads in the spotlight. This allows him to see if the change has an effect on clicks, shares, or sales. A/B testing allows for an even split of audiences and statistical comparisons."
185,"Granularity 1. User Segments: If Hamtaro wants to understand how different user segments respond to the changed ad positions, granularity should involve segmenting users based on relevant criteria such as demographics, geography, or user behavior. 2. Page-level vs. Site-wide: Depending on the goals, Hamtaro may choose to test the ad position changes on specific pages or site-wide. Granularity in this context would involve deciding whether to focus on a particular section of the platform or apply changes universally. 3. Device-specific Testing: If Hamtaro suspects that user behavior varies significantly between devices (eg, desktop vs. mobile), granularity could involve testing the ad positions separately for each device type. The attribution period should be short-term because 1. Immediate Impact Expectation: If Hamtube expects the changes in ad placement to have an immediate impact on user behavior (eg, increased ad clicks), a short-term attribution period may be suitable. 2. Transactional Platforms: For platforms where user interactions and decisions happen quickly, such as e-commerce websites or news platforms, a short-term attribution period may be more appropriate. 3. Resource and Time Constraints: If there are resource or time constraints, conducting a short-term test allows for quicker results and decision-making."
186,The key feature of A/B testing is that it is either A or B. It should be used because it tests whether changing the ad position will affect sales.
187,"Hamtaro should use A/B testing because A/B testing allows Hamtaro to clearly test the impact of changing ad placements by comparing a group that saw the ad in the old placement (control group) with a group that saw the ad in the new placement (experimental group). This experiment will reduce the effect of other variables that may affect ad clicks, such as user behavior or content types."
188,"Granularity is #checkout events/#hits to see if changing the location of the ads makes people see more, choose to buy more. Attribution period should be 2 weeks because in the first week people may not be familiar yet, but in the week when two people are more familiar, it will result in more stable values."
189,"The granularity should be reach because we want to know the number of people or groups that are likely to see the ad or access the content, and the length of the attribution period should be one day attribute period because to test the movement of the ad position, it will allow us to see the advertising results and user responses quickly, but it may not cover actions that occur over a long period of time."
190,"Hamtaro&#39;s A/B testing makes sense because: 1. A/B testing provides us with evidence to support our decision-making by comparing a group that saw the ad in the original position (Group A) and a group that saw the ad in the new position (Group B), to conclude how changing the ad position affects ad clicks. 2. A/B testing allows us to measure results precisely because dividing the experiment group into two groups allows us to clearly see the changes or differences in each group. 3. A/B testing reduces risk by experimenting before making any changes that will have a broad impact on user experience or platform revenue. 4. A/B testing can reduce noise by controlling other variables and changing only one variable, allowing us to measure the results without other factors."
191,Agree because the data is binary (click or not click) and independent (users who click are not related to users who do not click).
192,"50/50 gives an equal amount of exposure to the experiment between group A (exposed to the old location) and group B (exposed to the new location), which reduces the influence of other variables that might influence the outcome of the experiment. 80/20, giving a greater proportion of exposure to the new location, increases the chances of the experiment being that the new location has a favorable effect. If an equality experiment is desired and the expected outcome is not yet known, a 50/50 ratio might be appropriate. However, if there is a clear hypothesis and you want to increase the chances of testing a certain outcome, an 80/20 ratio might be an alternative."
193,"50/50 will allow you to collect complete samples faster, but it is more risky. 80/20 is slower, but less risky. I think 80/20 is more suitable because seeing the changed ads may annoy users, causing the platform to lose a lot of customers and lose a lot of revenue from seeing the ads."
194,"The 50/50 ratio will take less time but is more risky. On the other hand, the 80/20 ratio will take longer but is less risky. So if Hamtaro has enough time (which he probably does), he should choose the 80/20 ratio."
195,"A/B testing should be used because when testing the repositioning of an ad, there is uncertainty as to whether or not viewers will click through, so randomness is involved."
196,"Agree, because A/B testing is a type of testing that has a binary outcome: press or not press, by counting the number of times the event occurs in each experimental group. Binomial distribution is suitable for the number of possible times in this type of experiment."
197,"ad clicking events / # sessions: Since we want to see if the click rate is higher, the length of the attribution period should be within that session, since we only want to measure whether users click on the ad in a single session."
198,Agreed because each time a user comes across an ad the click chance is bernoulli and when combined it becomes binomial.
199," Binomial distribution is suitable for A/B testing because it contains only two outcomes (click or no click) and one user&#39;s click or no click on the ad does not affect other users, making it easier to manage data in case of large number of experiments."
200,"Agree because using a binary distribution allows us to distribute the choices of a large number of users and separate them into only 2 choices: click or do not click on the ad.
"
201,"Using a 50/50 ratio will allow you to collect A/B testing data faster than using an 80/20 ratio. However, using a 50/50 ratio is riskier because more than 50% of users will have to use the feature from the B test, which may not have been thoroughly tested because it is still in the experimental phase. This may cause some problems or create dissatisfaction among users. Therefore, choosing an 80/20 ratio, which will collect testing data slower, but does not require as much risk as choosing a 50/50 ratio, is more appropriate."
202,"50/50 Advantages: faster results, disadvantages: higher business risk. 80/20 Disadvantages: slower results, advantage: lower business risk."
203,"50/50 ratio - Advantages: It doesn&#39;t take long to collect all the data you want. - Disadvantages: There is a high risk that the new format may have problems and have a significant negative effect on the Hamtube. 80/20 ratio - Advantages: There is low risk, meaning that if the new format may have problems, the negative effect on the Hamtube will be small. - Disadvantages: It takes a long time to collect all the data you want. Choose the 50/50 ratio because it collects data faster, and if changing positions has a problem, it shouldn&#39;t be difficult to fix and move back to the original format."
204,"Agreed. By splitting the users for testing, Hamtaro can directly compare the results when changing the position of advertisements. This A/B testing approach allows for a clear evaluation of the impact of the ad position on user behavior."
205,"50/50 Advantages: Fast results, lots of data collection. Disadvantages: Customers may not like it, causing you to lose customers and lose sales. 80/20 Advantages: Less chance of losing customers and sales if customers do not like it. Disadvantages: It may take a long time to collect data. I think choosing 80/20 is safer for sales."
206,"The numerator is the number of times the ad is clicked (because we want to measure whether the number of ad clicks has increased or not). The denominator is the number of refreshes of the home page (including the first time the app is opened) (because with every refresh, the home page will move up to the top, showing the ad). The length should not be too long because people who use Hamtube do not primarily intend to watch ads. On average, Hamtube users use it for about 1 hour per day (guessing), so it should be recorded every 1 hour.

"
207,"Number of clicks on ads in the video / Number of views of the video Because the number of clicks is the value that is needed to measure the number of views as a denominator to compare with the total number of people who have watched the video (the same person watches the same clip, clicks and opens a new tab. When they come back to watch again, they don&#39;t think that the ad will be opened again.)"
208,"Agree, Controlling external factors in A/B testing is crucial to ensure the validity of the test results. External factors can introduce variability that can skew the data, leading to incorrect conclusions. For Hamtube, this means ensuring that any increase in ad clicks after moving ad positions is actually due to the change in ad placement and not external influences"
209,"The reason for not using the binomial distribution in A/B testing lies in the statistical characteristics of A/B testing, which differ from the scenario where binomial distribution might be suitable, such as when counting the number of occurrences of a specific event in a predefined number of trials. A/B testing, on the other hand, involves comparing two groups with different characteristics, and the metrics often revolve around continuous variables, making normal or t-distributions more appropriate for hypothesis testing."
210,"Agree because it is a test between the new ad position and the original position, which has 2 formats, so it is suitable for A/B testing."
211,"I disagree because an ad click can be clicked multiple times by one user, so should it be measured in the number of clicks before adjustment or not and is it a Normal Distribution?"
212,It is the number of times the ads are shown to the user. The length of the attribution period is 1 day to measure whether the user clicks on the ads within 1 day after the ads are shown to the user.
213,"50/50 has the advantage of being fair but requires a large sample size and there is a risk that the other half will be in a very bad position which will result in lost revenue. 80/20 has the advantage of being low risk and suitable for testing but nevertheless it takes time to test for results. The more suitable type is 80/20 because it has lower risk, if the results are good then it is not too late to adjust the ratio to increase the new positions."
214,"50/50 Advantages: It is systematic, all groups are tested equally, the results are accurate. Disadvantages: It requires a lot of capital and time. 80/20 Advantages: It may not require much investment and takes little time. Disadvantages: There is a chance that the results will not be accurate due to inequality. Therefore, hamtaro should choose the 50/50 type because hamtaro only wants to help increase sales, it does not need to consider the money that must be invested to increase sales."
215,"- Granularity: Ads clicking / hits because each time a website visit is made, there may be different ads (or assume that there is a randomized ad every time you refresh) - Attributtion period : 10 minutes because most users will see the ad immediately after clicking into that page. Therefore, the user will immediately decide whether to click to see the ad or not, which is a short period of time."
216,"Because it is possible to divide users into control, which is placing the same ad position, and treatment, which is placing the new ad position, and it is possible to measure the amount of change in the number of sales to perform statistical testing to conclude the results."
217,"50/50 Advantages: The experiment can be completed more quickly because the sample group can be completed quickly (both types can be completed at the same time). Disadvantages: High risk because users may prefer the old position. During the experiment, a lot of income will be lost. 80/20 Advantages: Low risk. If the new position is not good, it will not have a significant effect on income. Disadvantages: It takes a long time to complete the group of users who have the new position as planned at the beginning of the experiment."
218,"50/50 - Fast results, but high risk 80/20 - Slower results, but lower risk 80/20 is probably a better choice because retaining a user base is more important."
219,"2.1 Number of users who click on ads/Number of users who watch the entire video 2.2 3 hours because sometimes the video that users click to watch is very long. But mostly, if the video is longer than that, it is a video that users listen to more than watch, such as a video that includes long songs, so there is no need to pay attention."
220,"In terms of granularity, it&#39;s recommended to assign the frequency of ad displays to users to ensure an adequate level of detail during testing. Regarding the attribution period, it&#39;s best to keep it at only one day, enabling the measurement of clicks within a short time span after the ad is shown. This strategy facilitates an accurate and immediate evaluation of ad effectiveness."
221,"This makes sense because using a binomial distribution tells us the probability of how many people click on an ad, so we can tell if the distribution is actually increasing sales by using hypothesis testing."
222,"Granularity should look at the number of users who click on your ads each week, and the Attribution period should be long enough (around 1 month) to make the conclusions more accurate."
223,Agreed because we get success rate and number of viewers which can represent the distribution of this A/B testing.
224,I disagree because users may not see the same number of ads.
225,"I agree because when viewing an ad once, viewers have the right to choose not to click on it or to click on it, and the ad can appear multiple times."
226,"Using a 50/50 split for ad displays has scientific benefits, enabling quick and efficient testing due to its ability to gather extensive data rapidly. However, this method carries the risk of significant differences between the original (A) and new (B) ad placements, leading to less accurate and uncertain test results. In contrast, the 80/20 split offers theoretical advantages by reducing risks associated with the 50/50 split. Allocating fewer displays to the new placement (B) minimizes the risk if it doesn&#39;t perform as well as the original (A). Yet, the downside involves a time delay as it takes longer to accumulate data for the smaller proportion of ad displays, resulting in slower result analysis and marketing strategy adjustments. Therefore, the 80/20 split appears more fitting for the retailer&#39;s situation, aiming to manage risks in A/B testing within a shorter duration."
227,"50/50 Ratio: Pros: Allows Hamtaro to compare results equally between two groups, reducing the risk of unintended deviations. Cons: May have a negative impact on the overall user experience if the new ad placement is ineffective. 80/20 Ratio: Pros: Reduces the risk that a large number of users will have a bad experience if the change is ineffective. Cons: May make the results of the experiment less reliable due to a smaller sample size being exposed to the ads in the new placement. Which is better: For this experiment, a 50/50 ratio might be more appropriate to achieve equal and highly reliable data."
228,I disagree because there may be factors other than ad repositioning that affect users.
229,50/50 Advantages: Get information faster. Disadvantages: There is a chance of causing damage to the business. 80/20 Advantages: The impact on the business is not very high (in the case that the adjustment makes the ads pressed less). Disadvantages: Get information slowly. You should choose 80/20 to prevent damage to the business.
230,"granularity = #ads_clicked/#ads_seen #ads_clicked is the number of people who saw the ads and clicked (not counting duplicates) #ads_seen is the number of people who saw the ads (not counting duplicates) because we want to measure sales from the number of users who clicked on the ads attribution period = 1 day because clicks on ads occur in a short period of time, measuring within one day is appropriate."
231,"Granularity should be User who clicks/User who visits the attribution period of about 2-3 days. If it is too short, it will be difficult to remember the ad because users come in and focus mainly on the video. When it ends, they leave. But if it is too long, it may cause a bad user experience because they see the same ad frequently and in many places until they are dissatisfied and do not focus on the content or position in the end. Add and think that it is an event-based because it is an online platform for both releasing ads and counting sales. It is impossible for users to come back and click again after the trial is complete (ads in any position disappear)."
232,"Hourly or daily granularity to capture intraday or weekly variability. Attribution period by product type, such as a few days or 1 week for quick-to-buy products, and longer for products that require more time to decide."
233,"Agree with using A/B Testing because it can give measurable results, can see the change before and after the ad position change, can control the experiment ecosystem (control variables). "
234,It should be used because using A/B Testing will allow us to conclude which ad placement is more effective.
235,"
It is suitable for measuring user interactions on each visit, which helps to understand user actions when changing ad placements. The attribution period depends on the user&#39;s lifecycle. Hamtube must be sufficient to measure long-term results."
236,"Proportion 50/50. Advantages: Collect data quickly. Disadvantages: There is a high risk that the new position that is changed may not be as good as the original, causing people to click less. Proportion 80/20. Advantages: There is less risk because the percentage of new positions that are changed that will be shown to users is low. If it is not good, the effect is not much. Disadvantages: It takes a long time for the data to be complete. Therefore, the proportion 80/20 is more suitable for this problem. Because if using 50/50, it may affect the platform that has already been opened too much, so the risk is less."
237,"If as stated in the previous answer, I think Bernoulli should be used instead. However, if it is adjusted to compare the number of times people clicked on the ad in the sample (n successes in independent Bernoulli trials), it can be considered the same."
238,"The 50/50 ratio has the advantage of collecting data faster, but has the disadvantage that if the new position (B) that is placed has less clicks, it will lose the clicks that should have been from the original position (A). The 80/20 ratio has the disadvantage of collecting data slower because the proportion that is seen is only 20%, so it takes time to collect the full amount, but has the advantage that if the new position (B) that is selected has less clicks than the original, it will not affect the overall amount much. Choose the 80/20 type because the risk is lower when looking at it from the platform owner&#39;s perspective to minimize the impact, and the attribution period of only 1 day is not a long time. Therefore, collecting data to reach the desired amount does not take a long time."
239,"It should be used because A/B testing allows us to show whether changing the position of the ad will actually increase sales or not. In addition, what is being tested is simple and not new. That is why A/B testing is appropriate."
240,"
A/B testing is an effective way to test changes or improvements in marketing and advertising to measure and find out if there are any improvements in the effectiveness of an advertising campaign. The use of A/B testing here is to test whether moving the position of an ad in Hamtube will affect sales or not. In addition to reducing risk, it also helps to know the results of each change."
241,"Granularity = number of user id because we want to measure the number of users who visit hamtube and click on the ad. Attribution period = 1 day because when they see the ad, they decide whether to click or not. It takes a short time to decide."
242,"For A/B testing in Hamtube ad placement testing: Granularity: Should you choose &quot;User-level&quot; or &quot;Session-level&quot;? &quot;User-level&quot; is best for tracking long-term behavior, while &quot;Session-level&quot; is best for analyzing behavior on a session-by-session basis. Attribution Period: 7-14 days is good for measuring clicks after a user sees an ad. This period provides comprehensive data but is not too long-term."
243,"- 50/50 ratio is the ratio that will give you fast results because it changes by 50%, but if there is an error, it will have a greater impact. - 80/20 ratio will give you slow results, but if there is an error, it will have a smaller impact. - 80/20 is more appropriate."
244,Granularity: Number of ad clicks per number of cookies visited. Cookies are used because they are more accurate than counting hits/impressions and are more implementable. Attribution period: 1 day because watching a video should not take a long time.
245,"It should be a session granularity (number of times visited), it helps to understand how changing ad placement affects user actions in each session, with an attribution period between 1 and 4 weeks, depending on the user&#39;s cycle on the platform, because it allows to measure the impact of ad changes on user behavior over a long enough period to capture changes in behavior, and there are cases where some users may not be active every day, so having a longer period allows to capture a wider range of user actions."
246,"Granularity should be at a level appropriate to the analysis, such as per user or per view, depending on how granular the analysis is. Attribution period refers to the time period that determines when a click or other interaction is associated with a sale, which should be appropriate for the customer&#39;s purchase cycle, perhaps days, weeks or months, depending on how often the user interacts with the platform."
247,"Granularity = Number of users who click on ads / Number of users who see ads. Because it is easy to do and it gives direct access to the user&#39;s ad-clicking behavior. Attribution period = 1 day is the appropriate period because if we give too much period, there may be many factors that will make users come back and click on ads, for example, seeing ads elsewhere and then coming back to click on our website."
248,"Granularity is the number of people who click on an ad in each location / the number of times the ad is shown to users. The length of the attribution period is 1 day because it is the right amount of time, not too much or too little. If it is less than this, it may not be able to measure anything. If it is too much, people will see it often, so it may cut off the problem of clicking, making it impossible to see it on any given day."
249,"Agreed, because what hamtaro wants to do is to test between (A) the original ad position and (B) the new ad position to test whether moving the ad position increases sales or not. So, doing A/B Testing by measuring the clicks on the ads from the original ad position and the clicks on the ads of the new ad position by doing A/B testing."
250,"Numerator - number of times users clicked on the ad; Denominator - session number of times users visited Hamtube; timeout after 1 hour; attribution period: 1 hour, since each session takes at most 1 hour."
251,"For smaller companies in a hurry to choose the best feature, a 50/50 ratio may help us see results faster, but may come at the risk of greater revenue losses if the new feature performs worse than the previous one."
252,"Agree, because the number of ads shown already determines how many people will see A and B, and we want to find the click rate of each type, so we should use binomial distribution."
253,"Agree because the outcome of this test is a binary outcome (click/no click), which is consistent with using a binomial distribution.
"
254,"Because we judge by whether people check out or not, using bionomials is like combining several bernouli&#39;s together, which is appropriate."
255,"A/B testing has only two options: click on the ad (A) and no click (B), which corresponds to a binomial distribution that is appropriate for counting the number of times a user clicks on an ad, making it sensible to use a binomial distribution."
256,"50:50 Pros: - Results are not affected by irrelevant factors because the number of users who saw the old and new ads are the same. - Results are more reliable and comparable. Cons: - May lose revenue because fewer users saw the old ads, resulting in less revenue. 80:20 Pros: - Preserve current revenue because more users are still seeing ads in the old placement. - Reduces the proportion of users who saw the new placement, thus not losing as much revenue. Cons: - Leads to unequal experiments, which may lead to unreliable results. - Takes longer to collect data and verify results. Choosing the 50/50 ratio to get more comparable and reliable results because 80/20 may retain revenue, but the reliability of the results will be reduced."
257,"50/50 Advantages: Can collect data in full amount as required for testing quickly. Disadvantages: There is a risk that the new position that is changed to place the ad will be a position that users are much less interested in, causing the results from the old position to be greatly lost. 80/20 Advantages: Low risk because there is a low ratio of new positions. If there is a loss or the results of the new model are not available, we will not lose much benefit. Disadvantages: It takes a long time to collect enough sample data as specified. I choose 80/20 because to prevent high risk, to not lose too much benefit to the point of failure, and the attribution period of only 7 days is quite short. Therefore, we do not spend a lot of time collecting data."
258,"Granularity is the number of ad clicks, as this is the main goal of this experiment, and the attribution period is at least 1 month, as there needs to be enough time to collect new data to compare with the old data."
259,"Granularity: Number of users (by user id) who click on ads / Number of users who see ads in that format Attribution period: 1 day Reason: We chose this granularity because it reduces the need to truly understand each user&#39;s behavior and is still at an easily achievable level (check by account and assume that most users have only one account). The reason we chose 1 day for the period is because if we choose less, the content of the ads may affect the information received (users choose to click on some brands&#39; ads more). However, if it is more than this, it is highly possible that the click rate will be unrealistically high (if left for a long time, users will click on one of the ads, no matter the layout)."
260,Granularity is Hits/day and attribution period is 1 day to be able to analyze whether the ad move has an effect or not and not leave it for too long.
261,Hamtaro should use A/B testing because he already has the original ad placement on Hamtube and wants to know if changing the placement will affect sales. This is consistent with the nature of A/B testing where there is the same thing and he wants to know the result of changing to something new. A/B testing is suitable for online platforms that can adjust the placement of ads to different users.
262,"Agreed, because you can see that it is a combination of many Bernouli iterations (whether the user clicks on the ad or not)."
263,"The 50/50 ratio allows us to capture data and see differences quickly, but there is a risk that the new position change will be a bad position and cause lost revenue. The 80/20 ratio, because only 20% of users will encounter the new position, reduces the risk of bad position, but it takes longer to capture data than the 50/50. Choose the 80/20 ratio because it is less risky."
264,"It should be used because it allows testing whether moving the ad position has an effect on sales or not, by eliminating other factors that may affect ad clicks, such as inconsistent time periods. For example, if the two experiments are conducted separately, there may be one experiment that coincides with 11.11 or other days where the day and month numbers match, causing users to be more interested in the ad, which may increase the video click rate."
265,"50/50 has the advantage of providing balanced data and fast results, but the disadvantage is that if the change has a large impact, it will affect a larger number of users. 80/20 has the advantage of being less risky, but testing with a small impact may not capture the full picture of the usage of a wide range of users. It also takes longer to collect meaningful data, and the data may not be sufficient. There may not be enough information to create a reliable analysis. 80/20 is more suitable to reduce the risk of hamtube in case of making a mistake, there will be less damage."
266,"It is better to choose 80/20. 50/50 will give you fast results but it is high risk because if you do not move your position well, you will lose a lot of income opportunities. 80/20 takes a long time but has high accuracy. Therefore, I choose 80/20 more."
267,"The granularity should be ad clicks per ad impression, because if ad repositioning is really improving the user experience, they should click on the ad more often when they see it. The attribution period can be very short, around 1 minute, since we are measuring ad impressions and clicks, which are very rapid events. Testing to really see the effect of repositioning shouldn&#39;t take too long per attribution period. "
268,Granularity should be the number of times each user sees an ad. Attribution period is 1 day to measure whether users click on ads in that position in 1 day.
269,"Because A/B test is usually used to optimize marketing campaigns. In this case, Hamtaro wants to test whether changing the position of the ad will increase sales."
270,"50/50 Advantages: Get complete information quickly because both groups will take the same amount of time to collect samples. Disadvantages: 1. There is a risk to the business because if the Experimental creates a negative impact, it will greatly damage the business. 2. It is easy for independence to occur because when there are a large number of users seeing changes, the 2 user groups will talk to each other. 80/20 Advantages: Low risk Disadvantages: Collecting samples from small groups is slow. Choose 80/20 because the advertising system has a great impact on the business&#39;s income, so it should not be too risky."
271,Granularity is the number of userIds that clicked on the ad / the total number of userIds that saw the ad. The attribution period should be 1 day because the ads may be different every day.
272,"Pros/Cons 50/50 Pros: It takes less time to collect samples of 2 groups that see ads in different positions equally. Cons: The risk to sales is high because we don&#39;t know if the new model will have any problems that affect sales, such as causing sales to drop because people don&#39;t notice the new model. 80/20: Pros: It is less risky than the 50:50 model because the new model has only a 20 percent chance of being seen. Cons: It takes a long time to collect the same number of samples of users who see ads in both the new and old models. I think 80/20 is more suitable because even though it takes a long time to collect, the risk of problems that affect the original sales is reduced."
273,"Granularity - Medium to high Segmenting the data by different user groups or videos can help marketing teams gain a clearer picture of the results of an A/B test. Since Hamtube is a platform with a large number of users, an effective granularity would likely be medium to high. Attribution Period - 2 to 4 weeks, so that the impact can be detected immediately and over a medium to long period of time."
274,"
Using a binomial distribution in A/B testing is only appropriate when there is a binary outcome, such as clicks or no clicks, and a known number of trials. Using a binomial distribution makes the calculation and analysis of the results efficient. However, if the A/B test is more complex or involves many groups, other distributions may be more appropriate. The selection of distribution should take into account the nature and complexity of the test to determine the appropriateness for the situation."
275,Granularity should be the number of users who click on the ad because it reflects real user behavior and attribution period should be about 1 day because it is not too little and not too much.
276,"A/B testing should not be done; a normal distribution or t-distribution should be used, which is used to test the mean of two experimental groups."
277,"It should be because moving the ad position is not a significant change or a new format and the results are seen in a short period of time, splitting users easily and appropriately, making A/B testing appropriate."
278,"It should be used because it is an alternative way to test whether changing the ad position will affect sales or not. It is just two choices, not A or B, which is the main characteristic of AB testing."
279,"Granularity should be session level to measure user interactions across visits, useful for understanding how changes in ad placement influence user actions across sessions. The length of the attribution period is the length of time a user is tracked, which can be anywhere from 1-4 weeks to allow for longer-term tracking to measure the impact of ad changes on user behavior over the long term."
280,"Agreed, because this A/B testing has binary results, and using a binomial distribution makes it easier to test hypotheses."
281,A/B testing should be used to clearly show the results of changing the ad position with the old one at the same time and reduce the risk of changing to the new system.
282,"I disagree because the variability of each person&#39;s chances is high and we want to measure whether the click-through rate is higher, so it is better to use the Bernoulli distribution."
283,"Because using A/B testing by placing the A test in the same position and the B test changing the position of the ad will allow you to compare which of the two tests, which pass the same randomness, can increase the number of clicks by users on the ad more."
284,"Granularity: Days because it is not too short and not too long. Normally, online video platforms usually summarize viewership and other figures on a daily basis. If it is hourly, there will be variables related to different times in daily life, making it uncertain. Attribution period: 7 days because normally, on online platforms, users tend to decide to click on ads in a short period of time anyway, so there is no need to use a long time for testing. It also prevents the results from being distorted by other factors."
285,"Since moving the Ads position may or may not increase sales, A/B testing is required, divided into a control group and a test group to see the difference in sales in both groups."
286,Granularity: The experiment should be conducted at the individual level to assess the impact of the change on individual user behavior. Attribution Period: It should be 1-2 weeks as this is an ideal time to collect data and analyze the impact of the change on user behavior.
287,"A/B testing should be used to reduce the effect of randomness during the experiment. Since randomness occurs on both A and B, this randomness is constant on both. The results of the experiment will be due to the difference between A and B only."
288,"I suggest Hamtaro should implement a 50/50 split. 50/50 split Pros: 1. Equal Exposure: A 50/50 split ensures that both versions (old and new ad positions) receive an equal amount of exposure. This can be advantageous for a balanced comparison and helps minimize biases introduced by uneven exposure. 2. Faster Learning: An 50/50 split allows for faster learning about the performance of the new ad positions. The majority of users experience the new positions, providing a quicker assessment of their effectiveness. Cons: 1. Potential User Impact: If the new ad positions have a negative impact on user experience, exposing 50% of users to them may lead to dissatisfaction and a higher risk of negative consequences. 80/20 split Pros: 1. Limited User Impact: If the new ad positions have a negative impact, limiting exposure to 20% of users minimizes the potential negative consequences compared to a 50/50 split. Cons: 1. Slower Learning: If the new ad positions are significantly better, a 50/50 split might result in slower learning and delayed implementation of improvements. 2. Risk of Biased Results: An 80/20 split may introduce bias if the 20% of users exposed to the new ad positions are not representative of the entire user base. This could lead to skewed results and inaccurate conclusions. 3. Missed Opportunities: If the new ad positions are indeed better, an 80/20 split may result in missed opportunities for increased revenue or engagement for the 80% of users not exposed to the improvements.
"
289,"For granularity, it should be the number of times the ads are shown to the user so that the test has sufficient granularity. As for attribution period, it should be only 1 day so that the click results that occur within a short period after the ads are shown can be measured so that the advertising performance can be evaluated accurately and immediately."
290,"Because A/B testing allows you to directly compare the results and user behavior of ad placement changes, with less risk than immediate ad placement changes."
291,"Granularity depends on the sample size, e.g. higher granularity may be required to look at small-scale effects, or the ability to store and process data, e.g. higher granularity may result in a larger volume of data. The attribution period depends on the time commitment of the marketing team and the amount of data needed to support the experiment."
292,"Should have high granularity, should be the number of clicks on the ad because it is a detailed behavior, suitable for observing whether the ad position has an effect on increasing the number of views of the ad or not. Should have a short attribution period because it is necessary to know the response from the user immediately when seeing the ad at that position."
293,"Agree because the ad selection can only be 1 (click) or 0 (no click), so use binomial distribution."
294,"The advantage of the 50/50 model is that it can collect data in full quantity for testing quickly. The disadvantage is that there is a high risk that the new position (B) will be a bad position and will cause the loss of ad clicks that should have been received from the original. The disadvantage of the 80/20 model is that it takes a long time to collect complete data, but the advantage is that there is low risk because we will show type B to a small proportion of users. Therefore, if the display of type B is not good, it will not have much effect. The 80/20 model is chosen because the attribution period is quite short. Therefore, collecting complete data from this selection does not take too long and there is less risk."
295,"The 50/50 split will give faster results than the 80/20 split. The 80/20 split increases the risk of the experiment. I think the 50/50 split can be used because the placement of the ads is unlikely to cause problems for the system, allowing for faster data collection from the experiment."
296,"Granularity in the context of setting the attribution period for A/B testing refers to the level of detail at which the data is analyzed. For Hamtube, this could mean looking at the timing of ad clicks in relation to the ad placement changes to understand which granular time frame provides the most insightful data."
297,I agree because it is a comparison between the old (old advertisement) and the new (new advertisement).
298,"Granularity should be at a level sufficient to provide effective information for decision making. For Hamtube, an online video viewing platform with a large number of users, it is important to split the experiment into large enough groups to see significant results. Meanwhile, the attribution period should be the most appropriate time to measure the advertising effect, which may depend on the nature of the video and the interest of the viewers, and their preferences. "
299,"50/50 Proportion Advantages 1. Due to the equal proportions, hypothesis testing and outcome testing is efficient. 2. Results can be directly compared between groups. Disadvantages 1. If the results are not very different, it may be difficult to tell which change caused the result. 80/20 Proportion Advantages 1. The proportion that made the change is greater, making the experimental results clearer. 2. If we assume that a change will affect the result, the experiment time can be reduced. Disadvantages 1. The proportions of the two groups are not balanced, which may make the experimental results less reliable. 2. Analysis of the experimental results may be more difficult due to unequal proportions of each group. In conclusion, the 50/50 proportion is more appropriate because it gives more reliable experimental results and is more convenient to apply."
300,"50/50 If the new position ad is worse than the old position ad, it will hurt the original business more than the 80/20 ratio, but 50/50 will work for Type B faster than 80/20."
301,50/50 will give you quick results but risk losing morale. 80/20 will take a long time and cause less viewers.
302,"Agree, because there are only two outcomes: click or not click on the ad, and one user&#39;s decision does not affect other users."
303,"A/B testing can help Hamtaro test whether moving ad placements can increase click-through rates, without having to make major changes, just on a few videos. It&#39;s a simple, one-size-fits-all test that eliminates the risk of big changes to the system. All it does is provide data to help make a decision about whether to change the entire system or not."
304,"Agree, because each user click on an ad is an independent event, binomial is suitable for data in the form of success/failure, where the click on an ad can be viewed as data in this manner."
305,"80/20 because if the placement of the ad in the new location is not good, using the 50/50 ratio will make people see it more and may cause the sales to decrease significantly. So if you want to not have much risk, you should use 80/20."
306,"Agree: Binomial distribution is an appropriate choice for measuring outcomes with two states such as “click” or “no click”. This experiment wants to know if changing ad position affects clicks, which is appropriate for situations where a binomial distribution is used."
307,"50/50 ratio: Advantages: It helps the test to be complete and get quality data. Disadvantages: The test may not get enough data for verification because the change has little impact. 80/20 ratio: Advantages: The test will have a greater impact on the group that sees the new position more, which will reduce the testing time. Disadvantages: The data will be unbalanced, making it difficult to analyze the results and making the test unreliable. I think the 80/20 ratio is more suitable for this problem because the higher the ratio, the clearer the consumer behavior will be, allowing Hamtaro to know the market demand faster. However, it depends on the attribution period. If the period is long, Hamtaro can use the 50/50 ratio, which will give better results."
308,Granularity is the ID of the viewer of the video to track how many times the user has watched the video and clicked on the ad. The attribution period should be 7 days to get the real data about the click on the ad.
309,"A/B testing is a valuable tool for Hamtaro to experiment with changes in ad placement. It provides a systematic and controlled way to test hypotheses, ensuring that decisions are based on solid evidence. The insights gained from A/B testing can guide informed decisions about whether or not to implement the changes permanently across the platform."
310,"Agree because what hamtaro wants to test is a test between the original ad position (A) and the new ad position (B) to test whether moving the ad position actually helps increase sales or not. Therefore, doing A/B Testing by measuring sales from the original ad position and the new ad position by doing A/B Testing is appropriate."
311,Hamtaro should use A/B testing to test how to move the placement of his ads to increase sales because it compares the performance of two different variables: the current ad placement and the newly moved ad placement. Hamtaro can test these two ad placements with different audiences and see which placement results in more sales using A/B testing.
312,"Using a binary distribution in A/B testing makes sense if the outcome of the test is a binary outcome, meaning there are only two outcomes (e.g. click or no click), which is what happened in this ad test. If there are multiple outcome categories or other characteristics to analyze, a different statistical distribution may be needed."
313,"Reasons why Hamtaro should use A/B testing to test ad placement migration on Hamtube: Measure compelling business outcomes: A/B testing allows Hamtaro to accurately measure the effect of ad placement migration, whether it’s increased sales or clicks, which are crucial data for deciding on marketing changes. Improve ad performance: A/B testing helps marketing teams understand which placements generate more clicks from their ads, and can then help them optimize their ads for the most effective results. Reduce risk: A/B testing reduces the risk of making changes without any underlying data or evidence, allowing marketing teams to act on the insights gained from testing. Audience optimization: A/B testing helps Hamtube determine which ad placements are most suitable for their target audience, which can help tailor marketing strategies to user needs."
314,A/B testing should be used because considering the repositioning of ads and increasing sales (more users clicking on ads) involves randomness.
315,"Agreed, because Hamtaro wants to test whether moving the ad position (A) and the new ad position (B) will increase sales or not. Therefore, it makes sense to measure the increase in sales by measuring the clicks on the ad at the old and new positions using A/B testing."
316,"Hamtaro should use A/B testing to test which ad placement will increase sales more. Using A/B testing will help to find the conclusion, allowing to test the effect of changing ad placement on different target groups and reduce the risk that may occur from changing ad placement immediately."
317,"Agree because using binomial distribution is suitable for this case because there are only two possible outcomes: the user clicks on the ad and does not click on the ad, many times combined."
318,"50/50 is more risky for the user but will give faster results, while 80/20 is less risky (if the user does not like it) but will give slower results. It is recommended to choose 80/20 because it is more practical and much less risky."
319,"Select Hit rate, the ratio of ad clicks / number of times the ad is shown, because we believe that we will actually count whether the user clicks each time the ad is shown."
320,"number of users that click/number of users viewing ads on Hamtube attribution period : 3 days because it is a suitable period of time to know which position the user clicked. If it is longer than this, it may be uncertain which advertisement is influential."
321,"Agree because we fix the number of ads shown to users, such as Type A shows how many people, Type B shows how many people, and want to find the click rate of each type, so we should use binomial. "
322,"Granularity should be weekly, attribution period should be 7 days as it is suitable for advertising on Hamtube where buyers make quick decisions."
323,"Granularity: It is best to use a &quot;user-level&quot; granularity. This allows for detailed measurement and analysis of individual user behavior in response to ad placement changes. This level of analysis improves our understanding of how individual users respond to ads, which is important for assessing the impact of ad placement changes on clicks. Attribution Period: Choose a long attribution period of 30 days after an ad click because: A long attribution period allows us to capture more of the actions of users who click on an ad. This allows us to see the impact of an ad over a longer period of time and capture a more comprehensive view of user actions without missing important information that occurs shortly after an ad click."
324,"It should be used because it shows the results before making changes, thus reducing the risk."
325,"Granularity is the number of users who click on the ad. The duration of the attribution period should be 2-3 days because it depends on the user&#39;s behavior. If it is too short, it may receive too little data that is difficult to measure. If it is longer, it may cause users to click repeatedly."
326,Granularity: user-level - because the goal is to measure user reaction to changes in ad placement. Attribution Period: An ideal period might be between 1-2 weeks - because users may respond to an ad after viewing it several times or may take some time to decide to click on it.
327,50/50 is riskier but will give you faster decision-making results. 80/20 is slower but not as risky. 80/20 is more appropriate since advertising revenue is likely to be the platform&#39;s main source of income. It is not worth the risk.
328,Granularity is the number of times that people watch this video. It is not necessary to separate it by user ID because each time the user views the ad or not. Use the metric as the number of times the ad is clicked/the number of times that people watch the video. The attribution period should be 12 hours because people are unlikely to sit and watch the clip for more than 12 hours (take a break to eat. Watching continuously for a long time is not good for your health????)
329,"The granularity should be to collect data on every click on the ad on a daily basis to get a more detailed picture of Hamtube&#39;s user usage. The attribution period should be around 7 days to get reasonable or reliable data.
"
330,Agreed because the binomial distribution is suitable for two-group A/B experiments.
331,"Opting for user-level granularity in analysis and a 30-day attribution period provides a detailed and comprehensive understanding of how individual users respond to changes in ad placement. This approach allows Hamtaro to assess both short-term and long-term effects, leading to more informed decisions regarding the optimization of ad positions on the Hamtube platform."
332,"Granularity can be either User-level or Session-level, depending on budget and speed required. - User-level is more detailed, can track results in the long term, can do user segmentation by dividing characteristics such as website visit frequency, personal preferences, personal information (for example, in Facebook targeted ads, it will say Why am I seeing this ads? If you click to see, you will find that there are many factors such as you liked that page, you are this age, you are this gender). - Session-level, although cannot track or create personas, has faster speed and the data can be analyzed more easily. For Attribution Period, choose a week level because if it is too short, it may not be effective. If it is longer than this, the decision to see the ads may be due to other factors."
333,"Granularity is hits, which is the number of times the video is watched. Let the metrics be the number of clicks on the ad in the video / the number of times people watch the video. The reason is that we want to measure whether the change in ad placement causes more clicks or not, so we should measure it per video view, for example, whether the user clicks after watching or not. The attribution period is 1 hour, because we want to know whether seeing the ad in the video causes people to click right away, assuming that most videos are not longer than 1 hour."
334,I agree because it creates distribution and the choice of ad clicks is just 0 and 1: click or no click.
335,"50/50 split: Advantages: A 50/50 split allows for a large and systematic experiment, where all groups are tested equally. This reduces the potential for statistical error in the event of unequal distribution. Disadvantages: A 50/50 split can lengthen the time it takes to collect data and analyze it, as it requires waiting for enough data to make the results more reliable. 80/20 split: Advantages: An 80/20 split allows for more variation in the experiment group, which can help reflect better results more quickly. Disadvantages: An 80/20 split can lead to experiments that are not unequal in the experiments, which can make the results less reliable. A more suitable model is the 50/50 split, because what we want to achieve is equality, meaning we really want to know which one is better. We don’t want to rush anything, which means that the experiment may not need to be repeated because it is an unequal experiment. Another reason is that if a lot of users use hamtube, it means that we will have a lot of data to collect, so there is no need to rush."
336,"A/B testing should be used because A/B testing is a test that can compare 1 variable, in this case, the ad position, very well because the testers are divided into 2 groups, A and B, and each group will encounter different independent variables but otherwise the same, so if the results are different, the difference in results must be due to the independent variable."
337,"Hamtaro should use A/B testing to test changes in ad placements because A/B testing is a scientific way to test the effectiveness of changes by comparing two types of changes. Hamtaro can set the variable in the experiment to be the ad placement, divided into two versions as follows: Version A: Display ads at the original location; Version B: Display ads at a new location. Then, Hamtaro sets the target audience and advertising budget to be the same for both versions and starts experimenting for 1 month."
338,Agreed because the two situations are differentiated by only one variable: ad placement.
339,"The 50/50 model is riskier than the 80/20 model because the new model may cause a large loss of profit. However, the 80/20 model is slower than the 50/50 model because the sample size allocated to the new model is small. You should choose the 80/20 model to reduce the risk of losing profit from the new system."
340,"Choosing a binomial distribution for A/B testing is a good decision. Binomial distributions are used with variables that have only two outcomes (i.e. clicks or no clicks). In this case, it makes sense to use it to measure the number of times users click on ads in each group (control and experimental groups)."
341,"50/50 Ratio: Advantages: Equal comparison: Equal share provides an equal opportunity to compare results between the old and new placements. Disadvantages: Testing can be time consuming: If results do not differ significantly between the 50/50 groups, analysis and decision-making can take a long time. 80/20 Ratio: Advantages: Majority of new placements: Experiments with a larger proportion of ads can allow for more study and testing of the effectiveness of the new ad. Reduced risk: Reducing the proportion of new placements shown to users poses a lower risk of not seeing the new ad for the majority of users. Disadvantages: Unbalanced data: Segmentation can lead to imbalanced data among the groups that saw less of the new ad, which can affect analysis and conclusions. I think the 80/20 ratio should have the advantage that if the adjustment to the placement results in poor results or is unsuccessful, it will not affect a large number of users and can always be reversed with a smaller impact than the 50/50 model."
342,Total number of ads divided by total views and atrribution period set to 1 day because we are interested in how many viewers click on ads compared to those who watch them and set the days to not be too long to avoid other influences on purchases besides ad placement.
343,"Granularity should be the number of ad clicks per number of ad views, which is consistent with the hypothesis and makes it easy to draw conclusions, and the attribution period should be 1 day to reduce external factors."
344,"Agree, because click/no click is a bernoulli distribution, and we collect the number of clicks on the ad in the video/number of times people watch the video, counting only the first click, which is like doing bernoulli repeatedly but with a denominator, making it in the form of an average, a normalized binomial, and from the central limit theorem it becomes a normal distribution, so we can use a normal distribution instead."
345,"Agree, because what Hamtaro wants to test is a test between the original ad position and the new ad to test whether changing the ad position actually increases sales or not, so it should be A/B testing."
346,"Agreed, because it measures the probability of an ad being clicked or not, which is ideal for a binomial distribution that measures the probability of an outcome with two possible outcomes (occurring/not occurring)."
347,"
• Granularity: Hits/Impressions - the number of times a page is viewed. This is because if the user encounters an issue, we want to understand if &quot;users click on ads more.&quot; • Attribution Period: 1 day. This is suitable because website visits occur quickly, within a short timeframe."
348,"Advantages of 50/50 ratio: It provides balanced data from both groups, but may increase the test time. Advantages of 80/20 ratio: It provides more stable results and faster conclusions, but may introduce imbalances in the data, depending on which is more important, speed or balance."
349,"No. In general, in A/B testing, a distribution related to randomized hypothesis testing, such as the normal distribution or t-distribution, is used to test hypotheses about the means of two different experimental groups and to analyze the results of experiments that compare Group A and Group B. The reason is that the use of a binomial distribution in A/B testing is not possible because A/B testing has different statistical characteristics. A binomial distribution may be suitable for counting the number of times a specific event occurs in a given number of experiments, but it is not suitable for analyzing the results of A/B testing that compares experimental and control groups with different characteristics."
350,I disagree. I think the clicks are more of a normal distribution.
351,"Agree because it is a test where the user answers yes, no, which is a common situation in A/B testing and adds together, which results are independent of each other. "
352,"It should be used because it allows Hamtaro to compare the effects of changing ad placements in a controlled environment, allowing him to more clearly assess how much the change affected ad clicks."
353,-Granularity should be at the individual level to accurately track each user&#39;s behavior towards an ad click. This allows identifying which users are responding to changes in ad placement. - The length of the attribution period should be determined by the user&#39;s decision cycle and frequency of visits to the platform. It can start with 1-2 weeks and assess if there is enough data.
354,The granularity should be the number of users who watch online videos as tracked by cookies and the attribution period should be 1 hour because most online video viewing is less than 1 hour and the user clicking on an ad should not be a process that takes more than 1 hour because it will involve too many variables.
355,"It should be used to test the hypothesis that moving the ad position will actually increase sales, since we don&#39;t know how much impact changing the ad position will have on users."
356,"I agree with using the binomial distribution because it is suitable for tests with two outcomes: click on the ad or not click on the ad. Moreover, the distribution is simple and clear."
357,"50/50 can see results faster, but may risk losing a large number of Hamtube customers. 80/20 has lower risk, but results are slower. "
358,"If you choose 50/50, it will be riskier because if you make 50% of users who see the ad in the new location decide to click less, the sales will drop more. Therefore, you should choose 80/20 to reduce the risk until you are sure that the sales really increase before moving up the percentage."
359,"granularity -&gt; User Ids because if we really want to measure people&#39;s interest, we should measure from everyone who sees the Ads Attribute periods -&gt; 1 day because if the user sees the change and is interested, he/she will click right away. But if it&#39;s more than 1 day, it seems like the user might be interested in something else about the product in the ad. 
"
360,Agree with Hamtaro because the key decision is whether users click or not.
361,"It is used because it is a scientific method to help find answers or decide whether something should be done or not. A/B testing will try to remove the confounding factor, extract the complicated relationship to get only what we are interested in, which is a better method than using gut feeling or past experience to guess for sure.
"
