362,"Yes, because in this problem, the variable is the average of the click-through rate, which is a random value from Bernoulli n times and then averaged, and the binomial distribution n is the true distribution of the average value obtained from Bernoulli, making A/B testing with binomial distribution more accurate than testing with normal distribution obtained from CLT, but the method is more difficult and uses more computational resources."
363,"50/50 has the advantage of being able to collect test results faster because more people can access the new ad placement. However, it has the disadvantage of being risky in terms of business, namely, losing ad views from the new placement. 80/20 has the advantage of being that when the new ad placement is a smaller proportion, there is also less risk (users will still see the old one more often). However, the disadvantage is that it takes a relatively long time to collect test results. Choose 80/20 because in terms of business, it is quite gradual, low risk, and since the period is only 1 day, the data collection time does not take much longer."
364,1. Number of views 2. Number of ad clicks 3. Time of viewing The attribution period should be 1 day because watching a video does not take that long. 1 day should be the most suitable.
365,"Agree, because a click can have two possible outcomes: a click or a non-click, so a binomial distribution makes sense."
366,"50/50 - It will take less time to collect data, but has more risk to the business. 80/20 - It will take more time to collect data, but has less risk to the business. Assumption: Hamtube is a platform with a large number of users. Answer: 80/20 because it will not affect the income much."
367,"The granularity is # of clicks / # cookies on product page because Hamtaro only cares if users click on more ads, and the attribution period is 1 day because if users see an ad and are interested, they &quot;might&quot; click on it. Setting the attribution period to be higher than this doesn&#39;t make much sense."
368,Agree because clicking on an ad is just a yes or no.
369,"Granularity should be the number of users who have viewed the video, because it can tell how many users have viewed the video in total, and how many clicked on the ads. The length of the attribution period should be 7 days, because it can be checked to cover the whole season (whole week) and not too long a period."
370,Agree because it creates a click/no click distribution.
371,Granularity should be the number of clicks on the video. Attribution period should be the number of views of the video because the measurement is clicks and the denominator is the people who watch it.
372,"Agree because AB Testing will clearly show the difference whether the conversion is effective or not. Also, AB Testing will reduce the impact of randomness because doing it at the same time will be affected by the same randomness."
373,"The difference is 50/50 will get data faster because the ratio is equal, so you can get data from both sides equally quickly. But the disadvantage is that it is higher risk because the ratio of B is high, so there is a high chance that moving the position of the ad will cause the number of clicks to drop significantly. As for 80/20, you may get data slower than 50/50, but the advantage is that the risk is lower. Personally, I think 50/50 is more appropriate because moving the position of the ad is unlikely to cause that much risk to the business, and the advantage is that the results are faster."
374,"If it is a test in 2 different locations, if Hamtaro is in the episode of reducing uncertainty in decision making, A/B testing should be done to use statistics to draw conclusions. But if it is a comparison in many locations, A/B testing may not be the answer."
375,A/B testing should be used because Hamtaro can compare the original ad placement with the repositioned one.
376,"The 50/50 allocation is deemed more suitable. This is because the goal is to achieve equality and genuinely understand which variant performs better. There&#39;s no rush, and the aim is to avoid experiments that might not need to be repeated due to unequal testing conditions. Additionally, with a large user base on Hamtube, there is already a significant amount of data available, eliminating the urgency to rush the experiment. In summary, the 50/50 allocation is preferred for its emphasis on equality and the desire for reliable, conclusive results. This approach aligns with the principle of fairness in testing and allows for a thorough understanding of which variant is truly better."
377,"Using the 50/50 ratio will take less time to test than the 80/20 because there is a large split between the two versions, so the number of users (of both versions) will reach the desired number of users faster. On the other hand, if the new version tested has a lot of differences from the default version, if the new version does not work, the users will be more negatively affected. Therefore, the 80/20 split is better in terms of reducing the risk. For Hamtube, simply moving the ad position may not have a big negative impact (if not done anything extreme). Therefore, choosing the 50/50 split is more suitable because it takes less time and the risk is acceptable."
378,"Granularity Session level: Ideal for measuring user interactions on a per visit basis. It helps to understand how changes in ad placement affect user actions across sessions. Attribution Period: Between 1 and 4 weeks, depending on a userâ€™s lifecycle on the platform. Reason: Long-term monitoring: To measure the impact of ad changes on user behavior over a long period of time. Allowing enough time allows to capture changes in ad-clicking behavior or other engagement. Understanding the user cycle: Some users may not be active every day, so having a longer time period allows to better capture the overall user experience across a wider range of users."
379,"Not suitable because there are many factors that affect whether a user clicks or not, such as time spent on the platform, user engagement in other forms."
380,"If you use 50/50, you will get equality and collect information quickly because it is clear. But it may also affect the business because it may affect the money you get if many people dislike the new ads. As for 80/20, it is the opposite of 50/50, meaning it is slower to work but has less impact. If there is an error, the damage will be less. If you answer using a business hat, you should choose 80/20 because it has less impact on the business. But if you answer with time involved, you will choose 50/50."
381,1. It can be divided into many experiments that can be compared with each other. 2. Using statistics to support decision making is better than using intuition alone.
382,"Since one person can watch a video multiple times, the granularity should be the number of unique user ids that clicked to watch the video. The metric should be the number of ad clicks divided by the number of unique user ids. The attribution period should be 1 day, since a user&#39;s video viewing period will not exceed 1 day anyway. However, if the time period is less than 1 day, the data that should be obtained at some periods may be lost."
383,80/20 because it has less risk. The disadvantage is that it takes longer to collect data than 50/50.
384,"granularity: # hits (impressions) when a new page is viewed Since counting the number of times a user selects a new page should result in a new ad being displayed, it is best to count every time a new screen is viewed. attribution period: 12 hours Since a clip on an online video streaming platform should not exceed the specified attribution period, and it should also cover the entire user journey."
385,"#Total Ad Clicks/#Total Visits Because it allows us to know how much viewers are interested in clicking on ads each time they watch. The attribution period should be 1 day because viewers tend to watch hamtube frequently, so the period should not be too long."
386,"In the case of 50/50, it will take a shorter time to collect data but there is a higher risk that people will see the new ad layout and dislike it, resulting in a decrease in video viewing. 80/20 will take longer to collect data and is less risky. I think 50/50 should be used because it will take less time to collect data and I think the risk that people will dislike the new ad placement may not be high because people are not very interested in watching the ads."
387,"Granularity: Individual level, meaning that the results of the experiment should be analyzed separately for each individual to be able to identify how changes in ad placement affect individual behavior. Length of attribution period: At least 30 days to be able to identify how changes in ad placement affect viewer behavior over the long term."
388,"Granularity = # hits Attribution period is equal to the length of the video because each time a user watches a video, they see one ad."
389,"Granularity = Number of clicks on an ad / Number of ads shown (excluding repeated ads) Attribution period = According to the time the ad changes to another ad, for example, an ad changes every 1 minute, the attribution period should be 1 minute because if the user sees it and does not click when the time is up, it means that they are no longer interested."
390,"You can test whether placing ads in the same place and in a new place actually increases sales, which is something that can be measured with numbers and clear choices (i.e. placing ads in the same place and in a new place)."
391,"Ad clicks or video views, because it helps to better understand the user&#39;s trends and behavior towards ads. Attribution period is one week, which is considered to be balanced and helps to show growth."
392,"It should be user-level to accurately track individual behavior. It should be of a reasonable length, such as 1-2 weeks, to capture an overview of user behavior after seeing an ad."
393,"The 50/50 ratio allows for faster data from experiments, but if the repositioning has a negative impact, the impact will be greater. This is in contrast to the 80/20 ratio, which allows for slower data from experiments, but is less impacted if the repositioning has a negative impact. I personally think the 80/20 ratio is because whether or not the repositioning of an ad will increase sales does not necessarily require immediate results, and if it has a negative impact on the business, the impact will not be significant."
394,"# click on ads / # views on clips attribution period: 1 hour Reason: According to a report by wissa, social media clips longer than 30 minutes have the lowest viewer engagement rate, and clips of less than 1 minute have the highest viewer engagement rate. Clips of 30-60 minutes in length have a rate of no more than 26%, so they choose to cut the journey cycle of viewing a clip at 60 minutes."
395,A/B testing should be used because it is an effective way to test hypotheses and directly compare results between a test group (new ad placement) and a control group (the same ad placement). Using A/B testing will allow Hamtaro to effectively analyze and understand the effects of moving ad placements.
396,"Choosing a 50/50 ratio will allow you to complete your experiment faster than an 80/20, but it will be riskier. If Hamtube&#39;s revenue comes mostly from advertising, it may be riskier, and the 80/20 ratio may be better. However, if Hamtube has other sources of revenue besides advertising, the risk may be lower. In addition, since 50/50 takes less time, the 50/50 ratio may be a better choice."
397,"50/50 Ratio: Advantages: Equal experimentation: A 50/50 ratio ensures that the experiment is fair and all groups have an equal chance of being tested. Neutrality: This ratio is the most neutral of all the experiments and can help reduce the influence of other variables that may affect the results. Disadvantages: Does not provide the opportunity to test different ratios: If the new ad has a greater positive or negative effect on sales, giving the experiment an equal chance of 50/50 may not detect the change. 80/20 Ratio: Advantages: Giving the new ad a greater chance of being tested, making it more likely to detect the effect of the change. Disadvantages: Neutrality: Giving the new group more chance may result in uncertain marketing decisions and may be influenced by other unforeseen variables. Which of the following would be most appropriate for the problem? Agree: A 50/50 ratio would be appropriate for experiments that require neutrality and consistency, without giving more weight to either group. But if: If Hamtaro has reason to believe that the new ad has the most significant impact, the 80/20 ratio might be a good choice, as it offers a greater chance of detecting a significant impact."
398,"
It is not appropriate because the experiment is more complicated than just figuring out whether or not to click on an ad, as there are other data points such as time spent on Hamtube."
399,50/50 Advantages: You will learn about the changes quickly. Disadvantages: Users may get annoyed and never come back. 80/20 Advantages: There are fewer users who are likely to stop using because they are annoyed. Disadvantages: You will learn about the changes slowly. 80/20 Because there is less chance of losing users to other platforms.
400,granularity: Numerator - number of times users clicked on ads granularity: Denominator - session number of times users visited Hamtube; timeout after 1 hour attribution period: 1 hour since each session takes at most 1 hour.
401,It should be used because it is a method of experimentation and interpretation of experimental results supported by statistical principles.
402,A/B testing helps Hamtaro gain accurate data about the effect of ad placement changes by testing with real user groups and analyzing the results statistically. This reduces uncertainty in decision-making and gives more confidence in choosing the best option. It also helps Hamtaro improve the performance of its ad campaigns if it finds that ad placement changes result in more clicks on the ads.
403,"Hamtaro should use A/B testing because it allows him to systematically test whether moving ad placements increases user clicks, which provides statistical insights into his marketing decisions."
404,"50/50 is fast but high risk, 80/20 is less risky but slow. Choose 50/50 because it is faster."
405,It should be used because there is randomness involved in whether viewers will click or not due to the ad position being moved.
406,"Granularity - For the divisor, cookies may be chosen because it is difficult to check at the individual level or device id, or the use of user id requires login first, which is not necessary for using Hamtube or for clicking on the ad. Therefore, using cookies as the divisor is a good level of resolution and is the most possible to measure. Therefore, granularity is (#ad clicks) / (#cookies in Hamtube). Attribution Periods - It should be considered more that the ads we use have been advertised elsewhere, because the longer the period, the less accurate the results of the experiment will be due to other factors, such as the user has received a lot of ads from other places before, but then clicked on Hamtube. Therefore, a period of 1 week may be chosen because it is not too short to see the results and not too long for other factors to affect."
407,"I disagree because the graph between clip length and ad clicks shows that shorter clips like reels under 1 minute, which have much higher viewer engagement rates than longer clips, should get the most clicks."
408,"Agree, because knowing whether or not changing the position of an ad is effective depends on whether or not the user clicks on it. It&#39;s like a Bernoulli coin flip. When you combine many pieces of information, it becomes a binomial distribution."
409,"Granularity should be: Number of clicks on an ad, because having the number of clicks as a unit of measurement allows for a straightforward assessment of the effectiveness of an ad, focusing on clear interactions with the ad. attribute period: This could be a week or two for measuring medium-term impact. "
410,"50/50 Advantages: It is a balanced comparison, no bias, accurate. Disadvantages: It takes a long time to collect data, slow results. 80/20 Advantages: It collects data quickly, fast results. Disadvantages: The results may be biased, which may not be accurate. Choose 50/50 because even though it is slower to get data, we want correct and precise data."
411,"The 50/50 ratio is riskier because if it gives a worse result, it will cause more damage than the 80/20 ratio. In exchange for the advantage of being able to do tests faster, which is a trade-off that must be given because there are no more details specified in the problem, such as the average number of visitors, how long the platform has been open, and how popular it is. Therefore, let&#39;s assume that it is a large platform with a lot of users. Therefore, the answer is that the 80/20 ratio is more appropriate because it is lower risk. And in the case of a large platform with a lot of users already, it probably won&#39;t take long to get the number of tests as desired."
412,"Not suitable because of the limitations of the binomial distribution: If the experiment needs to analyze more complex effects than clicks or no clicks (e.g. time spent on the platform, other forms of user engagement), the binomial distribution may not be sufficient to capture those complex data."
413,"(Not sure what ad position means, but assume it&#39;s similar to YouTube, where when you enter the app, the ad will appear at the top, and the clips will be below, and the ad will only appear on the home page.) It should be used because it&#39;s an experiment comparing two things (the original ad position and the new position) that can be measured in numbers (number of ad clicks)."
414,"Agree because we do A/B Testing by measuring the number of people who click on the Ads link and the number of people who watch the video from both Position A and Position B, which are integers and we can set a fixed number of trials."
415,"The binomial distribution is used in A/B testing because it models the probability of a fixed number of successes in a series of independent experiments, which is relevant for Hamtube&#39;s A/B testing scenario where each ad click can be seen as a success or failure (click or no click), and each user&#39;s interaction with the ad is an independent event."
416,Agreed because Binomial distribution is derived from choosing between 0 and 1 which corresponds to click/no click of A/B testing.
417,"Agree, because each user is a bernoulli and then collected together as a binomial."
418,"Agree, because ad clicks are binomial events (click or not click) that fit into a binomial distribution."
419,"Using a 50/50 ratio gives fast results by exposing a large number of users to the ad placement, but can be detrimental to the platform if it is not liked by the majority of users. On the other hand, using an 80/20 ratio, despite taking longer to test, gives higher accuracy. Therefore, the 80/20 ratio seems to be a more appropriate method for making changes to features that have a large impact on the platform."
420,"Number of ad clicks/Number of unique ads shown to users attribution period=1 minute because we are interested in ad clicks, the number of unique ads shown to users because if the ad is repeated, the user may not be interested anymore (actually we want to measure when the user sees it but it is very difficult to do so) attribution period 1 minute because when people see an ad and are interested, they will click right away without taking a long time to think about it unless they don&#39;t see it."
421,"It is appropriate because it creates randomness, which makes more people come to watch."
422,Hamtaro should use A/B Testing because it is a test that divides visitors into 2 groups to clearly test the results of moving the old and new models. The results can be compared without bias.
423,"50/50: Advantages: The test is formal and uniform, making the results reliable and allowing the test to be customized as needed. Disadvantages: It may take longer to collect data, delaying analysis and decision-making. 80/20: Advantages: It is possible to collect data faster, reduce testing time, and experiment with changes in an environment close to real-world conditions. Disadvantages: It may be possible to make mistakes by eliminating most of the users who saw the old position, and the results may not be uniform, making it difficult to draw conclusions. I think 80/20 is more suitable for this problem because it provides fast results, even though the results may not be as accurate as 50/50."
424,"A/B Testing makes sense because it&#39;s great for testing differences between two versions, and is ideal for UX, conversion, and marketing processes, especially for design tweaks like Hamtube ad placement."
425,Agree because there is a large sample size.
426,"Agree because it is a test to find the difference between 2 types that are not much different, which is the position. Therefore, A/B testing is suitable for this test."
427,"It is often appropriate to use a binomial distribution to represent the distribution of A/B testing, as it is suitable for tests with only two options (A or B) and provides a convenient and clear analysis. When data comes from A/B tests that use a binomial distribution, the results tend to be more accurate and reliable."
428,"Agreed, using a binomial distribution is the most appropriate way to do A/B Testing because this test is characterized by only two possible differences in counts between two groups (A and B) (click or no click), and the counted variable is a binomial distributed variable. Therefore, using a binomial distribution is the most appropriate way to process the data and test the hypothesis here."
429,"Metric: Number of users who click on ads, because we want to count the number of users affected by the change of ad placement and prevent double counting caused by the same user clicking on the ad multiple times. Granularity: Number of times the ad is shown to the user. Attribution period: 12 minutes (average hamtube video length) to estimate that in 1 clip the user will see 1 ad and will see a new ad when watching the next clip, so the count can be changed when the ad shown to the user changes."
430,1. Helps to support decision making by comparing the results between Group A (original ad) and Group B (new ad) to understand the impact on ad clicks. 2. Helps to control for confounding factors and variables that may affect the results by randomly allocating users to each group to ensure reliable results. 3. Helps to clearly measure the impact of changes and check if there is an increase in ad clicks. 4. Small-scale experiments reduce the risk of negatively impacted decisions by allowing for adjustments before large-scale implementation. 5. Results can be used to continuously improve the platform and experiment with new approaches if changes do not work.
431,I agree with hamtaro because the click on the ad is a Bernoulli Distribution that tells the probability of clicking or not clicking the ad. The distribution of many viewers who come to watch (many Bernoulli rounds) becomes a Binomial Distribution.
432,"80/20 is better because hamtube is a large company. Using this ratio reduces the risk of a large number of users having a modified experience by ensuring that the majority of users continue to see ads in the same location. 50/50 Ratio Advantages: Balance: Even distribution of the ratio gives both groups equal weight in the analysis, reducing bias and providing balanced data. Ease of analysis: Having an equal ratio makes it easier to analyze the data and compare results. Disadvantages: More likely to change: Using a 50/50 ratio can result in a large number of users having a modified experience, which could have implications if the change is not beneficial. 80/20 Ratio Advantages: Reduced risk: Using an 80/20 ratio reduces the risk of a large number of users having a modified experience by ensuring that the majority of users continue to see ads in the same location. Good for high-risk experiments: If the change is high risk, this ratio allows for the ability to conduct an experiment without disrupting the experience of the majority of users. Disadvantages: Limited data available to the experiment group: With an 80/20 ratio, there will be less data from the group that saw the ad in the new location, which may result in less accurate analyses. **Long time to see results"
433,"Yes, Selecting the binomial distribution is appropriate for A/B testing due to the nature of counting differences between two groups (A and B) with just two potential outcomes (click or no click). This method relies on a variable that follows a binomial distribution, making it the most suitable approach for analyzing data and testing hypotheses in this context."
434,"Granularity is used in sessions as it counts the number of times a website&#39;s ads are called and can prevent users from accidentally clicking on it again within 15-30 minutes. The attribution period should be greater than 7 days, such as 7, 14, 30 days, as the days of the week include work and rest days which affect platform usage."
435,"Agree, because the clicks/no clicks on ads of many users are combined, the distribution is likely to be binomial."
436,"Granularity should be cookie with attribution period of 1 day because the testing platform is similar to YouTube where users will watch the video and the decision to click or not to click the ad will not take a long time. Therefore, setting the attribution period to only 1 day is enough."
437,"A/B testing is ideal because by comparing the original ad position (A) to the new ad position (B), you can understand how the change in ad position affects clicks on your ad. It also controls for noise, so you can see only the effect of the change in position. A/B testing can also be measured with precision, and to what extent."
438,"#Ad clicks and #views because it shows the ratio of how interested users are. The attribution period should be 1 day because it is enough to show that users are really interested in the ad, but not too little."
439,"50/50 Pros: Gives equal importance to both groups, making the comparison more reliable. Cons: May have short-term impact on the experience of a large number of users if the change does not work well. 80/20 Pros: Reduces the risk that a large number of users will have a bad experience if the change does not work well, while still having enough data from the experimental group to analyze. Cons: Data from the experimental group may not be as rich as in the 50/50 proportion, making the analysis less reliable. I think the 50/50 proportion may be a better choice, as it gives equal data between the control and experimental groups, making the analysis more reliable (but be prepared to accept the risk)."
440,"Agree, because each person records the results as a Rate of whether they clicked or not, which is a Bernoulli type distribution. And when collecting many results, the Rate will accumulate and become a Binomial distribution. 
"
441,"Agree because the binomial distribution is either yes or no, and this A/B testing can be used to select whether or not to click on the ad."
442,"A/B testing is a good idea because it allows him to test the current state of his ads and the movement of their placement, which allows him to see if moving the placement of his ads will affect user clicks and give him more confidence in making changes that will increase sales."
443,"Granularity = Number of ad clicks/Sessions attribution period = One-day 1. The reason for using Sessions is because when using an online video viewing platform, we think that most of the video lengths should not exceed 30 minutes, making it best to use a temporary session because we want to experiment whether ads at that time have an effect on purchases or not, and Sessions prevents counting in cases where users click to view ads multiple times in a single clip. 2. Choose to use One-day because if used more than this, viewers may have other factors that affect whether they go to view the product, which may not be the ad position that we adjust.
"
444,"The advantage of choosing 50/50 is that it will allow you to see the results of changing the ad position quickly, whether it is good or bad. The disadvantage of choosing 50/50 is that it is a very risky method because we are not sure of the results of the new ad position, which has a chance of reducing the number of ad clicks significantly from choosing a new method. The advantage of choosing 80/20 is that it is a safe method. If it is found that the new ad positioning is not good, it can be fixed or stopped without losing much income. The disadvantage of choosing 80/20 is that it takes longer to experiment than 50/50 because it collects data from Type B more slowly."
445,"The 50/50 method of dividing the ad display ratio has scientific advantages that can make the test fast and efficient. Because it can collect a large amount of data in a short period of time, the results can be analyzed and the marketing plan can be adjusted quickly. However, the disadvantage of using the 50/50 method is that it is very risky because it can cause unfair differences between the original ad position (A) and the new ad position (B), causing the test to be inaccurate and uncertain in interpreting the results. As for using the 80/20 method, it has the advantage in theory that it can reduce the risk caused by the 50/50 test by giving a smaller proportion of the new ad display (B). By choosing the 80/20 ratio, there is less risk in the event that the new position (B) is not as good as the original position (A). However, the disadvantage of the 80/20 method is that it is time-consuming because it takes longer to accumulate data in a small proportion of display, and it delays the analysis of the results and the adjustment of the marketing plan. Therefore, using the 80/20 method should be suitable for the problem that Hamtaro is facing, while controlling the risk caused by A/B Testing in a short period of time."
446,"A/B testing is recommended because it allows you to test both new and existing ad placement moves simultaneously, allowing you to directly measure the different impacts of these changes."
447,"I disagree because if we want to measure whether users click on ads more than before, we should measure the number of clicks rather than success or failure, and consider a normal distribution."
448,It is advisable to use A/B testing because the repositioning of an ad between action -&gt; outcome will have a randomness that will affect whether or not the viewer chooses to click on it.
449,- Using A/B testing will give Hamtaro data to compare which one gets more clicks from not moving or moving the ad position.
450,Agree because 1. You can divide the testers into groups (one part gets the old version + another part gets the improved version) 2. The time between users clicking ads is not very long.
451,"50/50 Advantages = Quick conclusion, reduces impact from external factors. Disadvantages = High business risk (if B[new 50] is not good, will lose benefits that should be gained from A, which is already good). 80/20 Advantages = Low business risk. Disadvantages = Slow conclusion, may be affected by external factors (if B[new 20] is not good, will lose benefits that should be gained from A, which is already good, not much). Choose 50/50 because you want to conclude results quickly, accept the risk, reduce impact from external factors."
